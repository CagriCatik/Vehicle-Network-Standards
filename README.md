![Deploy Docusaurus](https://github.com/CagriCatik/Vehicle-Network-Standards/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

This repository serves as a knowledge base for [**Vehicle Network Standards**](https://cagricatik.github.io/Vehicle-Network-Standards/). It provides structured information on widely-used protocols in the automotive industry, organized into the following categories:

- **AUTOSAR**
- **CAN** 
- **LIN** 
- **FlexRay**
- **ETHERNET**
- **DoIP** 
- **SOME/IP**
- **XCP** 
- **UDS**
- **SOVD**
- **SOVA**
- **SecOC**
- **FuSa**
- **FMEA**
- **OTA**


## About the Knowledge-Base

The content in this repository is the foundation of a Docusaurus-powered website that offers in-depth documentation, tutorials, and examples for these protocols. The website aims to provide clear, concise, and organized information for developers, engineers, and anyone interested in automotive communication standards.

### Features

- **Detailed Protocol Documentation:** Understand the fundamentals, use cases, and technical details of each protocol.
- **Easy Navigation:** Quickly access information with the help of a Docusaurus-generated webpage.
- **Open Contribution:** Contributions are welcome to improve and expand the content.

### Website

The documentation is hosted and built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Check out the live site here: [Vehicle Network Standards Documentation](#) (link to be updated once deployed).

## Folder Structure

Each folder represents a specific communication protocol and contains related documentation, code samples, and additional resources.
