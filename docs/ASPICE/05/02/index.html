<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process ID (SWE.3):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Process ID</strong> serves as a unique identifier within the ASPICE framework. The &quot;SWE&quot; prefix indicates that the process is part of the Software Engineering group, which focuses on the development and maintenance of software within the automotive domain. The number following the prefix (in this case, &quot;3&quot;) indicates the specific process within that group. SWE.3, therefore, is the third process under the Software Engineering category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This structured naming convention allows for easy reference and categorization of processes, facilitating communication and documentation across various stakeholders involved in the project.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Process Purpose</strong> section of the PRM articulates the specific functional objectives of the process. For SWE.3, the purpose is to &quot;provide an evaluated detailed design for the software units and to produce the software units.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the process is intended to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A detailed software design is created, which adheres to the architectural requirements established in earlier phases.</li>
<li>The software units are constructed based on this design, with a focus on meeting all specified functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
<li>The design and construction processes are validated to ensure they meet the required standards and that the software behaves as expected in its operational environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process Outcomes</strong> are critical as they define the specific, measurable results that should be achieved if the process is implemented successfully. These outcomes provide a clear benchmark against which the effectiveness of the process can be evaluated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For SWE.3, the outcomes include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Detailed Software Design:</strong> A comprehensive design is developed that fully describes the software units, ensuring all components are well-defined and meet the architectural requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Defined Interfaces:</strong> Interfaces of each software unit are specified, ensuring that components can communicate and interact seamlessly with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Behavior Description:</strong> The dynamic behavior of the software units, including their interactions, is clearly described, which is crucial for understanding how the software will operate in a live environment.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency and Traceability:</strong> There is consistency and bidirectional traceability between software requirements and software units, ensuring that every requirement is accounted for in the design and that the design can be traced back to the original requirements. This also includes traceability between the software architectural design and the software detailed design.</li>
<li><strong>Agreed Design:</strong> The software detailed design and its relationship to the software architectural design are agreed upon and communicated to all affected parties, ensuring alignment across the development team.</li>
<li><strong>Software Units Produced:</strong> Software units are constructed according to the detailed design, ensuring that they are ready for integration and testing.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Base Practices:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Base Practices</strong> are the activities that need to be performed to achieve the process outcomes. They are described at an abstract level, focusing on what needs to be done, without prescribing how these activities should be executed. This flexibility allows organizations to tailor their implementation of these practices to their specific contexts while still adhering to the ASPICE framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the SWE.3 process, the base practices include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SWE.3.BP1: Develop Software Detailed Design:</strong> This practice involves creating a detailed design for each software component, ensuring that the design specifies all software units with respect to both functional and non-functional requirements. The outcome of this practice is a comprehensive design document that guides the construction phase.</li>
<li><strong>SWE.3.BP2: Define Interfaces of Software Units:</strong> This practice requires identifying, specifying, and documenting the interfaces for each software unit. This is critical for ensuring that software components can interact correctly within the broader system.</li>
<li><strong>SWE.3.BP3: Describe Dynamic Behavior:</strong> This involves evaluating and documenting the dynamic behavior of software units and their interactions. Understanding how units behave and interact dynamically is essential for predicting system performance and identifying potential issues.</li>
