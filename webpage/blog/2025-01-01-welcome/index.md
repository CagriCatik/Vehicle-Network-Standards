Welcome to **Vehicle Network Standards**, because apparently, it’s not enough for cars to just drive anymore. They also need to chat, diagnose themselves, and argue over who’s in charge of the air conditioning.

## Why All This Overhead?

Once upon a time, vehicles were just about engines, wheels, and maybe a radio if you were fancy. But no, today we need **CAN**, **LIN**, **FlexRay**, **Ethernet**, and a small army of acronyms to ensure your seatbelt knows how to handshake with your headlights. You know, for "innovation."

## What Are We Even Doing Here?

This repository is here to help you navigate the **maze of vehicle communication standards** that someone thought were a good idea. Think of it as your survival guide to automotive networking, where we demystify:

- **CAN:** The protocol your car uses to whisper secrets between ECUs.
- **LIN:** CAN’s quieter, less expensive cousin that still gets the job done.
- **FlexRay:** Because sometimes you need deterministic communication at 10x the cost.
- **SOME/IP:** Service-oriented middleware, because why not bring enterprise-level complexity to your car?
- **UDS:** Diagnostics, so your car can complain about itself in a language only your mechanic understands.
- **AUTOSAR:** The grand orchestrator of it all, ensuring software modularity—or at least trying to.

## Why Docusaurus?

Because if we’re going to drown in acronyms, at least we can do it on a nice, responsive website. Docusaurus makes sure you can search, scroll, and maybe even find something useful before your coffee gets cold.

- **Readable docs:** Because no one wants to read the raw ISO spec. (Trust us, we tried.)
- **Navigation:** Quickly jump between protocols when you realize you’ve been Googling the wrong one.
- **Responsive design:** For those late-night debugging sessions on your phone while pretending to watch Netflix.

## Who’s This For?

- Automotive engineers who love standards so much, they can never agree on just one.
- Developers who thought they signed up to write cool algorithms but now spend their days parsing CAN frames.
- Enthusiasts who believe understanding SOME/IP will make them better dinner party conversationalists.

## Conclusion

If you’ve ever wondered, "Why can’t we just have one protocol that works for everything?" you’re not alone. But hey, until that happens, this repository is here to make sense of the chaos—or at least make you laugh while trying.
