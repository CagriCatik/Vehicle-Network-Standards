# Understanding the Term System

In Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) projects, the term “system” can be interpreted differently depending on the stakeholder’s perspective. For an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), the system generally refers to the complete vehicle or a major subsystem thereof. In contrast, for a Tier 1 supplier, “system” is often used in a more focused sense—typically referring to a specific electronic control unit (ECU) and its embedded software. ASPICE provides a framework to manage and assess these varying levels of system integration, ensuring that both broad and granular system definitions meet the high standards required in automotive development.

## OEM Perspective: The Car as a System

From the OEM viewpoint, the “system” usually represents the entire vehicle or a significant integrated feature. This broader definition encompasses multiple subsystems and components whose seamless operation is critical for overall vehicle performance.

### 1. System Architecture
- **Definition:** The system architecture in a vehicle covers the overall communication network and the integration of various subsystems. It includes protocols such as CAN (Controller Area Network), LIN (Local Interconnect Network), and increasingly, Ethernet.
- **Purpose:** This architecture defines the interaction between numerous ECUs, sensors, and other vehicle components, ensuring that data flows efficiently and reliably throughout the entire vehicle.

### 2. System Integration
- **Definition:** At the OEM level, system integration involves combining various hardware and software components—often through bench tests or in-vehicle integration—to form a cohesive system.
- **Purpose:** The goal is to verify that all subsystems operate together as intended. Successful integration is critical for ensuring that complex vehicle functions are delivered reliably under real-world conditions.

### 3. System Testing
- **Definition:** System testing from an OEM perspective includes comprehensive evaluations of the complete vehicle or major subsystems. Testing can take place on test tracks or via on-road trials.
- **Purpose:** This phase validates that the vehicle, as a system, meets all functional, safety, and performance requirements. It ensures that the end product will perform safely and reliably when deployed to the market.

## Tier 1 Supplier Perspective: The ECU as a System

For Tier 1 suppliers, the term “system” is often applied at a more granular level—referring primarily to a specific ECU or even a part thereof, along with the associated software.

### 1. System Requirements
- **Definition:** At this level, “system” refers to the detailed set of requirements for a particular ECU. These requirements specify functionality, performance criteria, and interface needs with other vehicle systems.
- **Purpose:** Clear system requirements provide the foundation for designing and developing the ECU so that it aligns with OEM expectations and integrates seamlessly into the larger vehicle system.

### 2. System Architecture (ECU Level)
- **Definition:** The system architecture for an ECU outlines the internal structure, including both hardware and software elements. It details the communication interfaces, data flows, and component interactions within the ECU.
- **Purpose:** This architectural blueprint ensures that the ECU is designed to fulfill its intended functions reliably while being compatible with the overall vehicle architecture.

### 3. System Integration (ECU Level)
- **Definition:** For Tier 1 suppliers, system integration involves activities such as flashing software onto the ECU, assembling the unit, and validating the interaction between its hardware and software components.
- **Purpose:** This step confirms that the ECU operates correctly as an integrated unit, which is critical before it is incorporated into the vehicle. It often includes preliminary integration tests in controlled environments.

### 4. System Testing (ECU Level)
- **Definition:** ECU-level testing covers functional tests as well as environmental (ENV) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests. These tests are designed to ensure that the ECU operates reliably under a range of conditions.
- **Purpose:** System testing at this level validates that the ECU meets all regulatory and performance requirements, ensuring that it can withstand the stresses of automotive operation while contributing to the vehicle’s overall performance.

## Conclusion

In ASPICE projects, the interpretation of the term “system” varies with perspective. For OEMs, “system” encompasses the entire vehicle or major subsystems, emphasizing comprehensive system architecture, integration, and real-world testing. For Tier 1 suppliers, the focus is narrower—centered on individual ECUs, including detailed requirements, internal architecture, and targeted integration and testing procedures.

This differentiated understanding is essential for effective collaboration between OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. By leveraging ASPICE’s structured process models, all parties can ensure that both high-level systems and their constituent components meet stringent quality, safety, and performance standards in the automotive industry.
