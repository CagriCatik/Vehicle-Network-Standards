# Process Capability Level 0: Incomplete Process (ISO/IEC 33020:2015)

In the context of the ISO/IEC 33020:2015 standard, which is used within the Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) framework, **Level 0: Incomplete Process** represents the lowest level of process capability. At this level, the process is either not implemented at all or is implemented so poorly that it fails to produce the necessary outputs.

## **Key Characteristics of Level 0: Incomplete Process**

1. **Non-Implemented Process:**
   - At this level, the process in question might be entirely absent. This means that the organization has not defined, documented, or executed the process necessary to achieve specific objectives within the software development lifecycle.
   - For instance, if an organization lacks a formalized process for software integration testing (SWE.5), any testing done may be ad hoc, unstructured, and potentially ineffective in identifying integration issues.

2. **Insufficient Evidence of Process Outcomes:**
   - Even if there is some form of process in place, Level 0 indicates that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the process achieves its intended outcomes. This could be due to a lack of documentation, poor execution, or failure to meet the process goals.
   - For example, in the case of configuration management (SUP.8), the organization might have some tools or activities in place, but there may be no consistent application, documentation, or proof that configurations are being managed effectively.

3. **Lack of Process Control:**
   - Processes at this level are typically unorganized, lack structure, and are not monitored or controlled. As a result, they cannot consistently deliver predictable results, leading to variability and potentially compromised product quality.
   - Without control, any process outcomes that do occur are more likely due to chance rather than by design, which poses significant risks, especially in safety-critical automotive systems.

## **Implications of Operating at Level 0**

Operating at Level 0 has serious implications for an organization:

- **Increased Risk:** The lack of structured processes increases the risk of defects, non-compliance with industry standards, and failures in the software or system. This is particularly critical in the automotive industry, where software reliability and safety are paramount.
- **Inefficiency:** The absence of defined processes often leads to inefficiencies, such as duplicated efforts, miscommunication, and wasted resources. This can result in project delays and cost overruns.
- **Poor Quality Outcomes:** Without a standardized process, the quality of the software and systems produced is likely to be inconsistent and unreliable, making it difficult to meet customer and regulatory requirements.

## **Moving Beyond Level 0**

To move beyond Level 0, an organization needs to focus on establishing and implementing fundamental processes. The first step is to define and document the process, ensuring that it is understood and consistently followed across projects. This involves:

- **Process Definition:** Clearly define the objectives, inputs, outputs, and activities of the process. This includes assigning roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability.
- **Process Documentation:** Create detailed documentation that describes how the process should be executed. This documentation should be accessible to all team members involved in the process.
- **Initial Implementation:** Begin implementing the process in a controlled manner, monitoring its effectiveness and making adjustments as needed.

Once the process is consistently performed and begins to produce the necessary outputs, the organization can then work towards achieving **Level 1: Performed Process** as part of its journey to higher levels of process maturity.

# Conclusion

Level 0: Incomplete Process reflects a state where processes are either absent or inadequately implemented, posing significant risks to project success and product quality. To overcome this, organizations must focus on establishing and documenting their processes, ensuring that they are consistently executed and capable of producing reliable outcomes. By doing so, they can begin to build a foundation for continuous improvement and higher levels of process capability within the ASPICE framework.
