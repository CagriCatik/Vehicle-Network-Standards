# Process Capability Level 1: Performed Process (ISO/IEC 33020:2015)

**Level 1: Performed Process** in the ISO/IEC 33020:2015 framework represents the first step beyond the "Incomplete Process" stage, indicating that the process is executed and produces the necessary outputs. This level is foundational, establishing the baseline for process maturity within an organization’s software development practices, especially as assessed through the Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) model.

## **Key Characteristics of Level 1: Performed Process**

1. **Process Performance (PA 1.1):**
   - **Definition:** At this level, the process achieves its specific, defined outcomes. The activities associated with the process are carried out, and the expected work products (i.e., deliverables or outputs) are produced.
   - **Focus:** The primary focus here is on the execution of the process itself, ensuring that it is consistently performed and results in tangible outcomes.

2. **Implementation of Base Practices:**
   - **Activity Implementation:** The base practices that define the process are implemented. This means that the organization follows a set of predefined activities that are necessary to achieve the process objectives.
   - **Work Products:** Work products and evidence of process performance are available. This includes documentation, code, test results, or any other outputs that demonstrate the process has been executed.
   - **Examples:** For instance, if the process is related to software requirements analysis (SWE.1), the outcome would include a documented set of software requirements that have been reviewed and approved.

3. **Evidence of Process Outcomes:**
   - **Documentation and Records:** At Level 1, it’s not just about performing the activities; there must also be evidence that these activities have been performed. This could include records of meetings, test results, configuration items, or other artifacts that prove the process was followed.
   - **Consistency:** While the process is performed, it might not yet be consistent across all projects or fully controlled. However, the existence of work products and documentation indicates that the process is active.

## **Implications of Operating at Level 1**

Operating at Level 1 indicates that an organization has moved beyond a chaotic or incomplete process state, but there is still significant room for improvement:

- **Baseline Functionality:** The process is functional and produces the intended outputs, but it may lack consistency and formalization. Different teams might perform the process differently, leading to variability in the results.
- **Foundation for Improvement:** Level 1 provides a foundation upon which more structured and managed processes (Levels 2 and 3) can be built. It’s a critical first step in achieving higher process maturity.
- **Risk Management:** While the process is performed, the lack of formal management might lead to risks such as incomplete documentation, overlooked steps, or inconsistent quality in work products.

## **Steps to Advance Beyond Level 1**

To advance beyond Level 1 and achieve **Level 2: Managed Process**, organizations should focus on the following:

- **Process Management:** Begin managing the process by tracking its performance, ensuring that all activities are planned, monitored, and controlled. This includes establishing clear roles and responsibilities for those involved in the process.
- **Consistency Across Projects:** Standardize the process across all projects to ensure that it is executed in a consistent manner. This reduces variability and improves reliability.
- **Formal Documentation:** Enhance documentation practices to ensure that all steps, decisions, and outcomes are recorded in a systematic way, facilitating better process control and transparency.

# Conclusion

**Level 1: Performed Process** is a critical stage in the ISO/IEC 33020:2015 capability maturity model, indicating that a process is not only present but also actively executed, producing the necessary outputs. While this level establishes a foundation for process functionality, organizations must strive to implement process management practices and standardization to advance to higher capability levels. By doing so, they can ensure more reliable and consistent outcomes, ultimately improving their overall process maturity within the ASPICE framework.
