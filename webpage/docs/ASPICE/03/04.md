# Process Capability Level 2: Managed Process (ISO/IEC 33020:2015)

**Level 2: Managed Process** represents the next stage in process maturity within the ISO/IEC 33020:2015 framework. At this level, the process is not only performed but also managed, meaning that it is systematically planned, monitored, and adjusted to meet specific objectives. This level introduces a higher degree of control and consistency across projects, which is critical for achieving reliable outcomes in software development, particularly within the Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) framework.

## **Key Characteristics of Level 2: Managed Process**

1. **Performance Management (PA 2.1):**
   - **Process Objectives:** 
     - Objectives related to time, cost, and quality are clearly identified and documented. This ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the process is expected to achieve.
   - **Resource Allocation:**
     - Resources and information are identified, made available, and appropriately allocated. This includes human resources, tools, and necessary data or documentation to support the process.
   - **Planning and Monitoring:**
     - Functionality, cost, and time are planned and actively monitored throughout the process. This involves tracking progress against the plan and making adjustments as needed to stay on target.
   - **Interface Management:**
     - Interfaces between involved parties are managed, ensuring clear communication and coordination across different teams or departments.
   - **Responsibility Assignment:**
     - Authorities and responsibilities are defined, assigned, and communicated to ensure that everyone involved knows their role and what is expected of them.
   - **Performance Adjustment:**
     - Process performance is adjusted to meet plans. If the process deviates from the plan, corrective actions are taken to bring it back on track.

2. **Work Product Management (PA 2.2):**
   - **Requirements Definition:**
     - Requirements for work products, documentation, and control are clearly defined. This ensures that the outputs of the process meet the necessary standards and are suitable for their intended purpose.
   - **Identification and Documentation:**
     - Work products are appropriately identified, documented, and controlled. This includes maintaining version control, ensuring traceability, and keeping comprehensive records of all outputs.
   - **Review and Adjustment:**
     - Work products are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary. This involves checking that the work products meet the defined requirements and making any necessary changes to improve quality or functionality.

## **Implications of Operating at Level 2**

Operating at Level 2 indicates a significant improvement over Level 1, with processes being systematically managed and controlled:

- **Enhanced Control and Predictability:** With clear objectives, resource management, and continuous monitoring, processes at Level 2 are more likely to achieve their intended outcomes consistently. This reduces the risk of project delays, cost overruns, or quality issues.
- **Improved Communication and Coordination:** Managing interfaces between different teams and clearly defining responsibilities ensures that everyone involved in the process is aligned, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings or miscommunications.
- **Better Quality Management:** The focus on work product management ensures that all outputs are carefully controlled, reviewed, and adjusted, leading to higher-quality results.

## **Steps to Advance Beyond Level 2**

To advance beyond Level 2 and achieve **Level 3: Established Process**, organizations should focus on further formalizing and standardizing their processes:

- **Process Definition:** Develop detailed process definitions that include standard operating procedures, guidelines, and best practices. These should be documented and made available across the organization to ensure consistency.
- **Process Deployment:** Ensure that the standardized processes are consistently applied across all projects and teams. This might involve training, audits, and ongoing support to help teams adopt and adhere to the defined processes.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Begin implementing mechanisms for continuous improvement, such as regular process reviews, feedback loops, and benchmarking against industry standards.

# Conclusion

**Level 2: Managed Process** marks a critical stage in process maturity where the focus shifts from merely performing processes to actively managing them. By establishing clear objectives, managing resources, and controlling work products, organizations can significantly improve the reliability and quality of their processes. Achieving Level 2 is a key milestone in the journey towards higher process capability, laying the groundwork for further standardization and continuous improvement as organizations strive to reach Level 3 and beyond within the ASPICE framework.
