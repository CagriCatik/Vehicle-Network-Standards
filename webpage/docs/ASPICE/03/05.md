# Process Capability Level 3: Established Process (ISO/IEC 33020:2015)

**Level 3: Established Process** represents a significant advancement in process maturity within the ISO/IEC 33020:2015 framework. At this level, processes are not only managed but also standardized, documented, and consistently applied across the organization. The focus shifts towards ensuring that processes are robust, repeatable, and adaptable to different projects, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and quality of the software development lifecycle, especially within the Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) framework.

## **Key Characteristics of Level 3: Established Process**

1. **Process Definition (PA 3.1):**
   - **Standard Process Definition:**
     - A standard process, including tailoring guidelines, is defined. This means that the organization has documented its processes, providing clear guidelines on how these processes should be applied in different contexts.
     - **Tailoring guidelines** allow for the adaptation of the standard process to meet the specific needs of individual projects while maintaining overall consistency.

   - **Sequence and Dependencies:**
     - The sequence and dependencies with other processes are identified. This ensures that the process is integrated into the broader organizational workflow, considering how it interacts with other processes.
     - Understanding these dependencies is crucial for coordinating complex projects, especially when multiple processes must work in concert.

   - **Roles and Competencies:**
     - Roles and competencies required to perform the process are identified. This includes defining the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to execute the process effectively.
     - By specifying roles and competencies, the organization ensures that the right people are in place to carry out the process, reducing the risk of errors or inefficiencies.

   - **Infrastructure and Work Environment:**
     - The necessary infrastructure and work environment to support the process are identified. This could include tools, software, hardware, and other resources required to perform the process effectively.
     - Ensuring that the right infrastructure is in place is essential for smooth process execution.

   - **Monitoring Methods:**
     - Suitable methods for monitoring the effectiveness and suitability of the process are determined. This involves setting up mechanisms to regularly assess whether the process is achieving its objectives and making adjustments as needed.
     - Regular monitoring helps in identifying potential issues early and allows for continuous improvement.

2. **Process Deployment (PA 3.2):**
   - **Defined Process Deployment:**
     - A defined process is deployed across the organization. This means that the standardized process is consistently applied in all relevant projects, ensuring uniformity and repeatability.
     - Deployment also involves ensuring that all team members understand the process and are committed to following it.

   - **Assignment of Roles and Responsibilities:**
     - Roles, competencies, and responsibilities are assigned to individuals performing the process. This clear assignment ensures accountability and helps in maintaining process discipline.
     - By assigning specific roles, the organization can ensure that every aspect of the process is covered and that there is no ambiguity in responsibilities.

   - **Training:**
     - Personnel performing the defined process are trained. Training ensures that all team members have the necessary knowledge and skills to execute the process as intended.
     - Regular training updates are important to keep pace with changes in the process or the introduction of new tools and techniques.

   - **Availability of Resources and Infrastructure:**
     - Resources and information are made available to support the process. This includes ensuring that all necessary tools, data, and materials are accessible to those involved in the process.
     - Infrastructure and work environments are also provided to facilitate effective process execution.

   - **Regular Process Measurement:**
     - Process measurements are done regularly to assess the performance of the process. This involves collecting data on key performance indicators (KPIs) and using this data to make informed decisions about process improvements.
     - Regular measurement and analysis help in identifying trends, spotting potential problems, and ensuring continuous alignment with process objectives.

## **Implications of Operating at Level 3**

Operating at Level 3 indicates a mature organizational capability where processes are well-defined, standardized, and consistently applied across all projects:

- **Process Consistency:** With standardized processes, the organization achieves a high level of consistency in how work is performed, leading to more predictable outcomes and higher quality products.
- **Scalability:** The ability to deploy standardized processes across multiple projects and teams allows the organization to scale its operations efficiently, without compromising on quality or performance.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regular monitoring and measurement ensure that the processes are continuously improved, adapting to new challenges and opportunities as they arise.

## **Steps to Advance Beyond Level 3**

To advance to **Level 4: Predictable Process**, organizations should focus on further refining their processes:

- **Quantitative Management:** Introduce quantitative measures to control and predict process performance. This involves using statistical methods to monitor process variations and ensure that they remain within acceptable limits.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Utilize the data collected from regular process measurements to make more informed decisions, focusing on reducing process variability and improving overall efficiency.
- **Optimization:** Begin identifying areas where processes can be optimized, not just standardized, to achieve better performance, reduce costs, and enhance product quality.

# Conclusion

**Level 3: Established Process** is a crucial milestone in process capability maturity, where the focus is on standardizing and consistently applying processes across the organization. By defining, documenting, and deploying these processes, organizations ensure that their software development practices are repeatable, scalable, and adaptable to different projects. As organizations move towards higher levels of process maturity, the emphasis shifts towards predictability and continuous improvement, driving further enhancements in process efficiency and product quality within the ASPICE framework.
