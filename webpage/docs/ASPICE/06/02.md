# Process Capability Levels of ISO/IEC 33020:2015: Level 2 - Managed Process

At Level 2 of the ISO/IEC 33020:2015 standard, the focus shifts towards establishing a **Managed Process**. This level is critical in ensuring that processes are not only defined but also consistently managed and controlled to achieve specific objectives. This is accomplished through the effective implementation of two key process areas: **Performance Management (PA 2.1)** and **Work Product Management (PA 2.2)**. These areas are further supported by a set of **Generic Practices (GP 2.x)** that provide detailed guidance on implementation.

## **PA 2.2: Work Product Management**

**Work Product Management (PA 2.2)** is crucial at Level 2 as it focuses on managing the outputs (work products) of the processes. This involves defining clear requirements for work products, ensuring they are documented and controlled, and reviewing and adjusting them to meet the necessary standards. The key activities within this process area include:

1. **Defining Requirements for Work Products:**
   - Work product requirements are established to ensure that the outputs of a process meet the necessary quality standards and fulfill their intended purpose. These requirements typically include the content, structure, format, acceptance criteria, and the frequency and method of reviews.

2. **Documentation and Control:**
   - Work products must be appropriately documented and controlled throughout their lifecycle. This involves assigning ownership, defining version control rules, managing the status of work products, and ensuring that they are stored in appropriate repositories. Additionally, traceability between work products is maintained to ensure that changes can be tracked and managed effectively.

3. **Identification, Documentation, and Control:**
   - Work products are identified, documented, and controlled in a systematic manner. This ensures that they are accessible to those who need them and that their status and history are well-documented. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and quality throughout the development process.

4. **Review and Adjustment:**
   - Work products are regularly reviewed against the defined requirements to ensure they meet the necessary standards. Any deviations are identified, corrected, and closed. If necessary, work products are adjusted, and changes are communicated to all relevant stakeholders.

## **GP 2.2.x: Generic Practices for Work Product Management**

The **Generic Practices (GP 2.2.x)** associated with Work Product Management provide specific guidelines on how to implement the activities mentioned above. These practices are essential for ensuring that work products are managed effectively and that they contribute to the overall success of the process. The key generic practices include:

1. **GP 2.2.1: Define Requirements for the Work Products**
   - **Interpretation:** This involves setting clear and detailed requirements for the contents, quality attributes, structure, format, and acceptance criteria of work products. Additionally, the frequency and methods of review are established, along with any necessary checklists for ensuring completeness and accuracy.
   - **Implementation:** Requirements are documented, ensuring that all stakeholders understand what is expected of each work product. Review processes are set up to verify that these requirements are met consistently.

2. **GP 2.2.2: Define Requirements for Documentation and Control of Work Products**
   - **Interpretation:** This practice focuses on managing the documentation and control of work products throughout their lifecycle. This includes establishing ownership, access rights, versioning rules, and storage structures. It also involves ensuring traceability between work products and managing changes effectively.
   - **Implementation:** Organizations implement tools and procedures for managing work products, ensuring that they are securely stored, easily accessible, and that any changes are properly documented and communicated.

3. **GP 2.2.3: Identify, Document, and Control Work Products**
   - **Interpretation:** This practice ensures that work products are systematically identified, documented, and controlled according to the established requirements. It involves implementing mechanisms to achieve the targets set in GP 2.2.2 and ensuring that work products are handled consistently.
   - **Implementation:** Work products are labeled, versioned, and tracked throughout their lifecycle. This ensures that they can be retrieved, reviewed, and modified as necessary, with a clear audit trail.

4. **GP 2.2.4: Review and Adjust Work Products to Meet Defined Requirements**
   - **Interpretation:** Regular reviews are conducted to ensure that work products meet the requirements defined in GP 2.2.1. If deviations are found, they are corrected, and the work products are adjusted as necessary. Reviews also help ensure that the frequency and coverage of the reviews are appropriate and that any issues are communicated to stakeholders.
   - **Implementation:** Review cycles are established, using criteria such as checklists to ensure completeness and compliance. Any adjustments needed are documented and communicated, ensuring that all stakeholders are aware of the changes and their implications.

# Conclusion

The **Level 2 - Managed Process** of ISO/IEC 33020:2015 within the ASPICE framework is centered on ensuring that processes are systematically managed and controlled, with a specific focus on managing the work products produced by these processes. Through the implementation of Performance Management (PA 2.1) and Work Product Management (PA 2.2), supported by the detailed guidelines provided by the Generic Practices (GP 2.2.x), organizations can ensure that their processes produce high-quality outputs that meet their objectives and are fully traceable and manageable throughout their lifecycle.

This level of process capability is vital for organizations aiming to establish a solid foundation for continuous improvement and higher levels of process maturity, ultimately leading to more reliable, efficient, and high-quality outcomes in automotive software development.
