## 1. **Application Layer**

The **Application Layer** encompasses the application-specific software components responsible for implementing the functional behavior of the vehicle's embedded systems. These components interact with the lower layers through standardized interfaces provided by the **Runtime Environment (RTE)**, ensuring seamless communication and integration.

### Key Features:
- **Vehicle-Specific Functionalities:** Implements features such as powertrain control, infotainment systems, body control modules, and more.
- **High-Level Logic:** Focuses on the application logic with minimal dependencies on hardware specifics, promoting portability and flexibility.

### Example:
Consider a cruise control system within a vehicle. The application software component for cruise control would include functionalities like maintaining the vehicle's speed, adjusting throttle positions, and responding to driver inputs. Below is a simplified representation of such a component:

```c
// CruiseControl.c
#include "CruiseControl.h"
#include "RTE_CruiseControl.h"

void CruiseControl_UpdateSpeed(void) {
    uint16 currentSpeed = RTE_GetCurrentSpeed();
    uint16 targetSpeed = RTE_GetTargetSpeed();

    if (currentSpeed < targetSpeed) {
        Accelerate();
    } else if (currentSpeed > targetSpeed) {
        Decelerate();
    }
}

void Accelerate(void) {
    // Logic to increase vehicle speed
    RTE_SetThrottlePosition(RTE_GetThrottlePosition() + 5);
}

void Decelerate(void) {
    // Logic to decrease vehicle speed
    RTE_SetThrottlePosition(RTE_GetThrottlePosition() - 5);
}
```

In a scenario where an application component manages the vehicle's headlights and another manages the CAN bus communication, the RTE ensures that data is correctly transmitted between these components without exposing hardware-specific details.

```c
// HeadlightController.c
#include "HeadlightController.h"
#include "RTE_HeadlightController.h"

void HeadlightController_SetState(bool state) {
    RTE_SendHeadlightState(state);
}

bool HeadlightController_GetState(void) {
    return RTE_ReceiveHeadlightState();
}
```

### Example Code Snippet:
Implementing a diagnostic service to read the status of an ECU might involve the following code:

```c
// DiagnosticService.c
#include "DiagnosticService.h"
#include "ECUStatus.h"
#include "RTE_DiagnosticService.h"

void Diagnostic_ReadStatus(void) {
    ECUStatus_t status = ReadECUStatus();
    RTE_SendDiagnosticResponse(status);
}

ECUStatus_t ReadECUStatus(void) {
    // Implementation to read ECU status
    ECUStatus_t status;
    // Populate status based on ECU readings
    return status;
}
```

## 4. **ECU Abstraction Layer**

The **ECU Abstraction Layer** is responsible for abstracting the hardware specifics of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). By providing a uniform API to the higher layers, it ensures that software components remain independent of the underlying hardware, facilitating portability and scalability.

### Key Features:
- **Hardware Peripheral Interfaces:** Manages interactions with hardware peripherals such as ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters), PWMs (Pulse Width Modulators), and GPIOs (General-Purpose Input/Output).
- **I/O Drivers Management:** Handles input and output drivers, ensuring efficient communication with various hardware components.
- **Uniform API Provision:** Offers a consistent interface for hardware access, hiding the complexities and specifics of the actual hardware.

### Example:
Handling ADC reads for a temperature sensor involves abstracting the hardware details to provide a simple API for higher layers:

```c
// TempSensor.c
#include "TempSensor.h"
#include "ECU_Abstraction.h"

float TempSensor_ReadTemperature(void) {
    uint16 adcValue = ECU_ReadADC(TEMP_SENSOR_CHANNEL);
    return ConvertADCToTemperature(adcValue);
}

float ConvertADCToTemperature(uint16 adcValue) {
    // Conversion logic from ADC value to temperature
    return (float)adcValue * 0.1f; // Example conversion factor
}
```

### Example Code Snippet:
Configuring a timer using the MCAL might involve the following:

```c
// Timer.c
#include "Timer.h"
#include "MCAL_Timer.h"

void Timer_Init(void) {
    MCAL_Timer_Configure(TIMER0, PRESCALER_64, MODE_PERIODIC);
    MCAL_Timer_Start(TIMER0);
}

void Timer_Start(void) {
    MCAL_Timer_EnableInterrupt(TIMER0, Timer_InterruptHandler);
    MCAL_Timer_Start(TIMER0);
}

void Timer_InterruptHandler(void) {
    // Handler code executed on timer interrupt
}
```

```c
// CustomSensorDriver.c
#include "CustomSensorDriver.h"

void CustomSensor_Init(void) {
    // Initialize proprietary sensor communication
    ProprietaryComm_Init();
}

uint16 CustomSensor_ReadData(void) {
    // Directly interact with proprietary hardware to read sensor data
    uint16 data = ProprietaryComm_Read();
    return data;
}
```
