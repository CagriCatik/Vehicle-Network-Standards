## 3. **Functional Flow Across ECUs**

This section delineates the step-by-step processes that govern the interactions between the **Front ECU** and the **Roof ECU**, ensuring coordinated lighting control based on door statuses and user inputs.

### 3.1 **Door Status Monitoring (Front ECU)**

**Objective:** Continuously monitor the status of the vehicle's doors and communicate changes to the **Roof ECU** to manage lighting accordingly.

**Workflow:**

1. **Status Detection:**
   - The **Left Door** and **Right Door** SWCs monitor their respective doors, detecting states such as `OPEN` or `CLOSED`.
   
2. **Status Aggregation:**
   - The **Door Contact** component receives status updates from both door SWCs.
   - It aggregates these statuses to determine if any door is open.

3. **Status Transmission:**
   - The aggregated door status is sent to the **Roof ECU** over the communication bus.
   
**Code Example:**

```c
// DoorContact.c
#include "DoorContact.h"
#include "VFB_Interface.h"

void DoorContact_SendStatus(bool leftDoor, bool rightDoor) {
    bool doorOpen = leftDoor || rightDoor;
    VFB_Send("DoorStatus", doorOpen);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `DoorContact_SendStatus` function aggregates the statuses of the left and right doors.
- It utilizes the `VFB_Send` function to transmit the aggregated status (`doorOpen`) to the **Roof ECU**.

### 3.2 **Lighting Control (Roof ECU)**

**Objective:** Adjust the vehicle's lighting based on door statuses received from the **Front ECU** and manual inputs from the **Switch** component.

**Workflow:**

1. **Status Reception:**
   - The **Roof ECU** receives door status information from the **Front ECU** via the communication bus.
   
2. **Brightness Adjustment:**
   - The **Dimmer** component processes the received door status along with any manual inputs from the **Switch**.
   - It calculates the appropriate brightness level based on these inputs.

3. **Light Activation:**
   - The **Light** component receives the calculated brightness level from the **Dimmer**.
   - It adjusts the physical lighting hardware (e.g., LEDs) to reflect the desired brightness.

**Code Example:**

```c
// Dimmer.c
#include "Dimmer.h"
#include "VFB_Interface.h"

void Dimmer_AdjustBrightness(bool doorOpen, int switchInput) {
    int brightness;
    
    if (switchInput > 0) {
        brightness = switchInput; // Manual brightness level from Switch
    } else {
        brightness = doorOpen ? 100 : 0; // Full brightness or off based on door status
    }
    
    VFB_Send("LightBrightness", brightness);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Dimmer_AdjustBrightness` function determines the brightness level based on door status and manual switch input.
- If the `switchInput` is greater than 0, it prioritizes the manual input; otherwise, it sets brightness based on whether any door is open.
- The calculated brightness level is sent to the **Light** component via `VFB_Send`.

## 6. **Challenges and Solutions**

Implementing a distributed architecture within an AUTOSAR-based lighting control system presents several challenges. This section addresses these challenges and provides effective solutions to mitigate potential issues.

### 6.1 **Synchronization Across ECUs**

**Challenge:** Ensuring real-time updates and synchronized operations between the **Front ECU** and the **Roof ECU** is critical for maintaining consistent lighting behavior based on door statuses and user inputs.

**Solutions:**

- **Deterministic Protocols:** Utilize communication protocols like FlexRay that offer deterministic data transmission, ensuring timely delivery of critical messages.
  
- **High-Priority Messaging:** Assign high priority to essential signals (e.g., door status updates) within protocols like CAN to prevent delays.
  
- **Timestamping:** Implement timestamping mechanisms to track message delivery times and ensure synchronization between ECUs.

**Implementation Example:**

```c
// Synchronization Example in RTE
void RTE_SynchronizeECUs(void) {
    // Ensure that door status messages are processed before lighting commands
    if (IsDoorStatusUpdated()) {
        ProcessDoorStatus();
        AdjustLighting();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `RTE_SynchronizeECUs` function ensures that lighting adjustments are based on the latest door status updates, maintaining synchronization between the **Front ECU** and the **Roof ECU**.

### 6.2 **Fault Handling**

**Challenge:** Managing communication failures between ECUs is vital to maintain system reliability and prevent unexpected behavior.

**Solutions:**

- **Fallback Modes:** Implement default behaviors when communication failures occur. For instance, defaulting to maximum lighting brightness if door status cannot be determined.
  
- **Heartbeat Mechanisms:** Use heartbeat messages to monitor the health of ECUs and detect communication breakdowns promptly.
  
- **Redundancy Checks:** Validate incoming data to ensure its integrity before processing, reducing the impact of faulty or corrupted messages.

**Implementation Example:**

```c
// Fault Handling in DoorContact.c
#include "DoorContact.h"
#include "VFB_Interface.h"

bool ValidateDoorInput(bool doorStatus) {
    // Simple validation logic
    // In real-world scenarios, more complex validation can be implemented
    return (doorStatus == true || doorStatus == false);
}

void DoorContact_ReceiveInputs(bool leftDoorStatus, bool rightDoorStatus) {
    bool validLeft = ValidateDoorInput(leftDoorStatus);
    bool validRight = ValidateDoorInput(rightDoorStatus);
    
    if (validLeft && validRight) {
        bool anyDoorOpen = leftDoorStatus || rightDoorStatus;
        VFB_Send("LightingRequest", anyDoorOpen);
    } else {
        // Handle invalid input by defaulting to safe state
        VFB_Send("LightingRequest", false);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `ValidateDoorInput` function ensures that door status inputs are valid before processing.
- If either door status is invalid, the system defaults to a safe state by deactivating the lighting.
