## 2. **Sender-Receiver Communication Flow**

The S/R communication model delineates clear roles for software components, ensuring organized and efficient data exchange. This section explores the roles of sender and receiver components, the intermediary role of the RTE, and provides a practical mapping example.

### 2.1 **Sender Component**

- **Role:**
  - Acts as the **Sender** in the communication, responsible for providing data to one or more receiver components.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - Utilizes a **Provide Port (P-Port)** to expose and transmit data elements.
  
- **Example:**
  - A **Dimmer SWC** sends brightness levels to a **Light SWC** through its P-Port.

### 2.2 **Receiver Component**

- **Role:**
  - Serves as the **Receiver**, obtaining data from sender components to perform necessary operations.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - Utilizes a **Require Port (R-Port)** to receive and consume data elements.
  
- **Example:**
  - A **Light SWC** receives brightness values from a **Dimmer SWC** through its R-Port.

### 2.3 **Runtime Environment (RTE)**

- **Role:**
  - Acts as the middleware that manages and facilitates data flow between sender and receiver components.
  
- **Functionality:**
  - **Data Routing:** Maps data elements to signals for transmission over the communication bus.
  - **Abstraction:** Provides a hardware-independent interface, ensuring that SWCs remain decoupled from the underlying hardware specifics.
  
- **Example:**
  - The data element `DoorOpen` is mapped to the signal `DoorLeft_Open` and transmitted via the CAN bus.

### 2.4 **Mapping Example**

Consider the following scenario to illustrate how data elements are mapped and transmitted within the S/R communication model:

- **Components Involved:**
  - **Dimmer SWC** (Sender)
  - **Light SWC** (Receiver)
  - **Door Sensor SWC** (Sender)

- **Data Flow:**
  - The **Dimmer SWC** sends a `Light_Dimm` data element through its **Provide Port (P-Port)**.
  - The **Light SWC** receives this data through its **Require Port (R-Port)**.
  - The `DoorOpen` data element from a sensor is mapped to the `DoorLeft_Open` signal and transmitted over the CAN bus.

## 3. **Implementation Details**

Implementing the S/R communication model involves defining how data is sent and received between components, configuring the RTE, and ensuring that data is correctly mapped and handled. This section delves into the practical aspects of implementing sender and receiver functionalities.

### 3.1 **Sender Implementation**

The sender component is responsible for transmitting data to the receiver via the RTE. This is typically achieved using the `Rte_Write` function provided by the AUTOSAR RTE API.

#### **Code Example:**

```c
// Dimmer SWC: Provide Light Dimming Data
#include "Rte_Dimmer.h"

void Dimmer_SendBrightness(uint8_t brightness) {
    // Write the brightness value to the RTE
    Rte_Write_Dimmer_Light_Dimm(brightness);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function:** `Dimmer_SendBrightness`
  - **Purpose:** Sends the current brightness level to the RTE.
  - **Parameter:** `brightness` (uint8_t) representing the desired light intensity.
  
- **Operation:**
  - Utilizes `Rte_Write` to transmit the `Light_Dimm` data element to the RTE, which then maps it to the corresponding signal for transmission.

### 3.2 **Receiver Implementation**

The receiver component retrieves data from the sender through the RTE, often using the `Rte_Read` function. Upon receiving the data, it processes and acts upon it as required.

#### **Code Example:**

```c
// Light SWC: Retrieve Light Dimming Data
#include "Rte_Light.h"

void Light_ReceiveBrightness(void) {
    uint8_t brightness;
    
    // Read the brightness value from the RTE
    Rte_Read_Light_Light_Dimm(&brightness);
    
    // Adjust the light intensity based on the received value
    AdjustLightBrightness(brightness);
}

void AdjustLightBrightness(uint8_t brightness) {
    // Logic to adjust the lighting hardware, e.g., PWM signal
    SetPWMOutput(brightness);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function:** `Light_ReceiveBrightness`
  - **Purpose:** Retrieves the brightness level from the RTE and adjusts the light accordingly.
  
- **Operation:**
  - Calls `Rte_Read` to obtain the `Light_Dimm` data element from the RTE.
  - Passes the retrieved brightness value to `AdjustLightBrightness`, which interfaces with the hardware to set the desired light intensity.

### 3.3 **Example for Door Status**

This example demonstrates how a door sensor component communicates door status information to other components via the S/R model.

#### **Workflow:**

1. **Sensor Detection:**
   - A door sensor detects whether a door is `OPEN` or `CLOSED`.
   
2. **Data Transmission:**
   - The sensor SWC sends the `DoorOpen` data element through its **Provide Port (P-Port)**.
   
3. **Data Mapping and Bus Transmission:**
   - The RTE maps the `DoorOpen` data element to the `DoorLeft_Open` signal.
   - The signal is transmitted over the CAN bus to the relevant receiver components.
   
#### **Code Example:**

```c
// DoorContact SWC: Sending Aggregated Door Status
#include "Rte_DoorContact.h"

void DoorContact_SendStatus(bool leftDoor, bool rightDoor) {
    bool doorOpen = leftDoor || rightDoor;
    // Write the door status to the RTE
    Rte_Write_DoorContact_DoorStatus(doorOpen);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function:** `DoorContact_SendStatus`
  - **Purpose:** Aggregates the statuses of the left and right doors and sends the overall door status to the RTE.
  
- **Operation:**
  - Combines the individual door statuses (`leftDoor` and `rightDoor`) using a logical OR operation to determine if any door is open.
  - Utilizes `Rte_Write` to transmit the aggregated `DoorStatus` data element, which the RTE maps to the `DoorLeft_Open` signal for bus transmission.
