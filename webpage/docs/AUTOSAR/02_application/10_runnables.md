## 12. **Integration Example: Door Monitoring System**

To consolidate the understanding of Runnables within an AUTOSAR-based system, consider the following integration example involving a **Door Monitoring System**.

### 12.1 **System Components**

- **Left Door SWC:**
  - Contains Runnable `SA_Left` to monitor the left door's status.

- **Right Door SWC:**
  - Contains Runnable `SA_Right` to monitor the right door's status.

- **RTE:**
  - Manages Runnable invocations and data exchange between SWCs.

- **Lighting Control SWC:**
  - Contains Runnable `ProcessDoorStatus` to adjust interior lighting based on door statuses.

### 12.2 **Workflow**

1. **Initialization:**
   - System initializes all SWCs and configures Runnables with their respective triggers and priorities.

2. **Periodic Monitoring:**
   - Every 200 milliseconds, Runnables `SA_Left` and `SA_Right` are triggered to read door statuses.

3. **Data Transmission:**
   - Each Runnable writes the door status (`OPEN` or `CLOSED`) to the RTE using `Rte_Write` functions.

4. **Data Processing:**
   - Runnable `ProcessDoorStatus` in the Lighting Control SWC is triggered upon receiving new door status data.
   - It reads the latest door statuses using `Rte_Read` functions.
   - Based on the door statuses, it invokes lighting adjustments through `Rte_Call` functions.

5. **Lighting Adjustment:**
   - If either door is open, interior lights are turned on.
   - If both doors are closed, interior lights are turned off.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Any errors encountered during reading or writing operations are handled gracefully, ensuring system reliability.

### 12.3 **Diagrammatic Representation**

    DataExchange -->|Rte_Read_DoorStatus| DoorStatusData[Door Status Data]
    ProcessDoorStatus -->|Rte_Call_LightingService_SetInteriorLights| InteriorLights[Interior Lights]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Left Door SWC:** Periodically triggers `SA_Left` to monitor the left door's status and sends it to the RTE.
  
- **RTE:** Facilitates data exchange between the Left Door SWC and the Lighting Control SWC, ensuring that the latest door statuses are available for processing.
  
- **Lighting Control SWC:** Triggers `ProcessDoorStatus` to adjust interior lighting based on the received door statuses.

### 12.4 **Code Snippet Integration**

**Left Door SWC Runnable: `SA_Left`**

```c
// Runnable: SA_Left - Monitors Left Door Status
#include "Rte_LeftDoor.h"

void SA_Left(void) {
    Std_ReturnType status;
    boolean DoorOpen;

    // Read the left door sensor
    DoorOpen = ReadDoorSensor(DOOR_LEFT_SENSOR_PIN);

    // Write door status to RTE
    status = Rte_Write_LeftDoor_DoorStatus(DoorOpen);

    if (status != RTE_E_OK) {
        HandleRteWriteError(status);
    }
}
```

**Lighting Control SWC Runnable: `ProcessDoorStatus`**

```c
// Runnable: ProcessDoorStatus - Adjusts Lighting Based on Door Status
#include "Rte_LightingControl.h"

void ProcessDoorStatus(void) {
    boolean LeftDoorOpen;
    boolean RightDoorOpen;
    Std_ReturnType status;

    // Read door statuses from RTE
    status = Rte_Read_LightingControl_LeftDoorStatus(&LeftDoorOpen);
    if (status != RTE_E_OK) {
        HandleRteReadError(status);
        return;
    }

    status = Rte_Read_LightingControl_RightDoorStatus(&RightDoorOpen);
    if (status != RTE_E_OK) {
        HandleRteReadError(status);
        return;
    }

    // Determine lighting state
    if (LeftDoorOpen || RightDoorOpen) {
        // Turn on interior lights
        Rte_Call_LightingService_SetInteriorLights(true);
    } else {
        // Turn off interior lights
        Rte_Call_LightingService_SetInteriorLights(false);
    }
}

void HandleRteReadError(Std_ReturnType errorCode) {
    // Implementation for error handling
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Runnable `SA_Left`:** Monitors the left door's status and sends it to the RTE.
  
- **Runnable `ProcessDoorStatus`:** Reads both door statuses from the RTE and adjusts interior lighting accordingly by invoking a lighting service.
  
- **Error Handling:** Both Runnables include error handling mechanisms to manage potential issues during data transmission and reception.
