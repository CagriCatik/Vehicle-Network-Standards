### AUTOSAR Application: Distribution of Components

### 1. **Roof ECU**

The **Roof ECU** contains components that handle the lighting control within the vehicle's roof area, such as switches, dimmers, and the lights themselves.

- **Switch**:
  - **Role**: The switch is responsible for sending user inputs, such as turning the lights on or off or adjusting the brightness. 
  - **Interaction**: It communicates with other components through the **RTE** and sends commands to the **Dimmer** component for adjusting the lighting.

- **Dimmer**:
  - **Role**: The dimmer adjusts the brightness of the light based on inputs from the switch or other commands. 
  - **Interaction**: It receives signals from the switch via the RTE and sends output to control the intensity of the **Light** component.

- **Light**:
  - **Role**: This component represents the actual lighting system controlled by the ECU.
  - **Interaction**: It receives control signals from the dimmer and adjusts the lighting state accordingly.

- **RTE (Runtime Environment)**:
  - **Role**: The RTE provides the middleware necessary for the interaction between software components (Switch, Dimmer, Light) within the ECU. It abstracts the communication between components and manages data flow.
  - **Interaction**: The RTE facilitates the exchange of messages between the components on the Roof ECU and connects to the Front ECU via the bus for broader system control.

- **BSW (Basic Software)**:
  - **Role**: The BSW contains the standardized software components that provide essential services such as communication, diagnostics, and memory management. It is located beneath the RTE and handles low-level functionalities.
  - **Interaction**: The BSW interacts with the hardware through the **Controller** and provides services to the upper software layers.

- **Controller**:
  - **Role**: The controller is the hardware interface responsible for executing the low-level commands and controlling physical devices such as the lights.

### 2. **Front ECU**

The **Front ECU** handles the components related to the door system and the door contact sensors that communicate with the lighting system.

- **Door Contact**:
  - **Role**: This component detects whether the vehicle's doors are open or closed. It sends this information to the **Dimmer** via the RTE to trigger actions such as turning the lights on or off.
  - **Interaction**: The door contact component communicates with both the left and right door components and transmits data to the dimmer through the RTE.

- **Left Door** / **Right Door**:
  - **Role**: These components detect the open or closed state of the respective doors. Their status is sent to the **Door Contact** component, which consolidates this information.
  - **Interaction**: Both the left and right doors communicate their status to the door contact component via the RTE.

- **RTE (Runtime Environment)**:
  - **Role**: The RTE in the Front ECU functions similarly to the one in the Roof ECU, providing communication between the door-related components (Door Contact, Left Door, Right Door) and ensuring their interaction with the Roof ECU via the bus.
  - **Interaction**: The RTE ensures that the door status data is sent to the dimmer on the Roof ECU to control the lighting system.

- **BSW (Basic Software)**:
  - **Role**: Like in the Roof ECU, the BSW provides necessary lower-level functionalities, such as communication, through the controller.
  - **Interaction**: It interacts with the hardware through the controller and offers services to the upper layers.

- **Controller**:
  - **Role**: The controller is the physical hardware interface that executes low-level commands for the door components.

### 3. **Communication via the Bus**

- **Bus**:
  - **Role**: The bus acts as the communication medium that connects the two ECUs (Roof ECU and Front ECU). It allows for the transfer of information between components distributed across the ECUs, such as transferring door status data from the Front ECU to the Roof ECU.
  - **Interaction**: The bus ensures that data from the door components (on the Front ECU) is sent to the lighting system (on the Roof ECU) in real time, ensuring coordinated control across the system.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Distribution of Components**: The AUTOSAR architecture supports the distribution of software components across different ECUs. In this system, the lighting control components are divided between the **Roof ECU** (for switches, dimmers, and lights) and the **Front ECU** (for door contacts and door status).
  
- **Runtime Environment (RTE)**: The RTE in each ECU facilitates the communication between software components, ensuring seamless interaction between components distributed across different ECUs. This abstraction enables modular development and integration of components from different vendors.

- **Bus Communication**: The bus enables communication between different ECUs, allowing distributed systems to work together as a single cohesive unit. For instance, door status information is shared with the lighting system via the bus.

- **Modularity and Scalability**: The AUTOSAR system shown here is modular, with components easily added, removed, or updated without affecting the overall system. This modularity allows for greater scalability, making it possible to expand the system as needed.

### Conclusion:
The **distribution of components** across the **Roof ECU** and **Front ECU** showcases the power of AUTOSAR's modular architecture, allowing software components to be distributed and communicate via the **bus** and **Runtime Environment (RTE)**. The system is scalable, reusable, and ensures interoperability between the different components, enabling more efficient development and maintenance of automotive software systems.
