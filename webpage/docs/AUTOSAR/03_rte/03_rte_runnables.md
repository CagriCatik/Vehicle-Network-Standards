# RTE as Runtime Environment for Runnables

The **Runtime Environment (RTE)** is the middleware layer in AUTOSAR that ensures seamless interaction between Software Components (SWCs), the Operating System (OS), and the Basic Software (BSW). Its primary role is to manage **Runnables**—the smallest executable units in AUTOSAR—by triggering them based on predefined events and facilitating communication between SWCs.

## **1. RTE Overview**

### **Key Characteristics:**
1. **Configurable Middleware**:
   - Maps Runnables to OS tasks during configuration.
2. **Event-Based Execution**:
   - Triggers Runnables using predefined RTE events.
3. **Task Configuration**:
   - Defines task priorities, alarms, and scheduling mechanisms for efficient execution.
4. **Customizable**:
   - Each ECU has a unique RTE tailored to the SWCs it hosts.

## **2. Mapping and Execution of Runnables**

### **2.1 Mapping Runnables to OS Tasks**
- During system design, RTE maps each Runnable to an OS task.
- Tasks are configured based on priority, frequency, and triggering events.

#### Example: Dimmer SWC
- **Runnables**:
  - `AP_Init`: Initializes the dimmer system at startup.
  - `AP_Dim`: Adjusts brightness based on external signals (e.g., `Contact`).
- **Mapping**:
  - `AP_Init`: Mapped to an initialization task.
  - `AP_Dim`: Mapped to an event-based task triggered by the `Contact` signal.

### **2.2 RTE Event Triggers**
Runnables are triggered by specific events defined in the RTE configuration. The table below summarizes common events:

| **Event**                      | **Description**                                   | **Example Use Case**                       |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Init**                       | Triggered during system initialization.           | SWC initialization (e.g., `AP_Init`).      |
| **TimingEvent**                | Periodic trigger based on a timer.                | Sensor data processing every 20ms.         |
| **DataReceivedEvent** (S/R)    | Triggered when new data is received.              | Adjusting brightness based on `Contact`.   |
| **DataReceiveErrorEvent** (S/R)| Triggered on data reception failure.              | Diagnostic monitoring.                     |
| **OperationInvokedEvent** (C/S)| Triggered when a server operation is called.      | Handling diagnostic service requests.      |
| **ModeSwitchEvent**            | Triggered when a mode switch occurs.              | Switching between normal and diagnostic mode. |

#### Example Workflow:
1. A `Contact` signal is received by the RTE.
2. The RTE triggers the `AP_Dim` Runnable in the Dimmer SWC.

## **3. Communication Through RTE**

The RTE enables communication between SWCs and between SWCs and the underlying OS/BSW. This is achieved through **Sender/Receiver (S/R)** and **Client/Server (C/S)** communication paradigms.

### **3.1 Sender/Receiver Communication**
- SWCs exchange data through ports managed by the RTE.
- Data flow is event-based or periodic.

#### Example:
- A sensor SWC sends the `DoorOpen` signal:
  ```c
  Rte_Write_Sensor_DoorOpen(doorState);
  ```
- An actuator SWC reads the signal:
  ```c
  Rte_Read_Actuator_DoorOpen(&doorState);
  ```

### **3.2 Client/Server Communication**
- SWCs invoke operations or services provided by other components.
- Suitable for complex interactions, such as diagnostics.

#### Example:
- A client SWC calls a diagnostic operation:
  ```c
  Rte_Call_DiagnosticService_ReadData(&diagnosticData);
  ```

## **4. RTE Customization**

### Key Considerations:
1. **ECU-Specific Configuration**:
   - Each ECU has a unique RTE reflecting its SWCs and system role.
2. **Task Configuration**:
   - Defines task priorities and scheduling for Runnables.
3. **Event Mapping**:
   - Associates Runnables with events to ensure correct triggering.

---

## **5. RTE Code Generation**

The RTE generates executable code for each ECU based on the system configuration. This includes:
1. **Task Routines**:
   - Code to execute Runnables.
2. **Event Handlers**:
   - Logic to trigger Runnables based on events.
3. **Communication Interfaces**:
   - Code to manage data exchange through ports.

#### Example Code:
```c
void Rte_Task_Dimmer(void) {
    // Periodic task to trigger the Dimmer SWC's Runnable
    AP_Dim();
}
```

## **6. Key Benefits of the RTE**

1. **Hardware Abstraction**:
   - SWCs remain independent of underlying hardware.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Supports simple and complex systems with multiple ECUs.
3. **Interoperability**:
   - Standardized communication between SWCs.
4. **Deterministic Behavior**:
   - Ensures predictable execution of critical tasks.

---

## **7. Use Case: Interior Lighting System**

### **Workflow**
1. **SWC1**: Monitors door state and sends a `Contact` signal.
2. **SWC2 (Dimmer)**:
   - Runnable `AP_Init` initializes the dimmer system at startup.
   - Runnable `AP_Dim` adjusts brightness based on the `Contact` signal.
3. **RTE**:
   - Routes the `Contact` signal from SWC1 to SWC2.
   - Maps and schedules the execution of `AP_Init` and `AP_Dim`.

---

## **8. Summary**

The **RTE** in AUTOSAR provides a robust framework for managing Runnables, facilitating communication, and abstracting hardware dependencies. By using event-based triggers and configurable tasks, the RTE ensures modular, scalable, and efficient execution of automotive software systems.

### **Key Takeaways**:
- The RTE maps Runnables to OS tasks and defines their triggers.
- It supports both **Sender/Receiver** and **Client/Server** communication.
- Each ECU has a customized RTE tailored to its SWCs.
