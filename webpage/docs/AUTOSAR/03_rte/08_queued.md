# Sender/Receiver Communication: Queued

In the **AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture)** framework, **Queued Sender/Receiver (S/R) Communication** represents a sophisticated communication paradigm designed to handle event-driven data exchanges between Software Components (SWCs). Leveraging an **event-based semantic** (`isQueued=true`), this mechanism employs receive queues to manage multiple data instances, ensuring data consistency and deterministic behavior. Queued S/R Communication is particularly suited for scenarios requiring reliable event handling and the preservation of data sequences, such as sensor data streams and interrupt-driven systems.

## 1. Key Features of Queued Communication

Queued Sender/Receiver Communication introduces several key features that enhance the robustness and flexibility of data exchanges within AUTOSAR-based automotive systems. These features ensure that data is handled efficiently and predictably, catering to complex communication requirements.

### 1.1 Event Semantic

**Event semantic** defines how data exchanges are managed and processed within the communication paradigm. In Queued S/R Communication, the event semantic is pivotal for ensuring that data is handled in an orderly and reliable manner.

#### **Polling Receive**
- **Description:** 
  - In polling receive, the receiver SWC actively checks the receive queue for new data.
  - The receiver periodically invokes the `Rte_Receive` API to fetch available data.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Control Over Execution:** The receiver determines when to check for new data, allowing for optimized scheduling.
  - **Flexibility:** Suitable for scenarios where data arrival is unpredictable or infrequent.
- **Example Use Case:**
  - A diagnostic module that periodically checks for fault codes without continuous monitoring.

#### **Waiting Receive**
- **Description:** 
  - In waiting receive, the receiver SWC blocks and waits for new data to arrive in the receive queue until a predefined timeout occurs.
  - The receiver invokes the `Rte_Receive` API and remains in a blocked state until data is available or the timeout is reached.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Efficiency:** Reduces unnecessary polling by waiting for data, conserving processing resources.
  - **Deterministic Behavior:** Ensures that data is processed as soon as it becomes available, enhancing responsiveness.
- **Example Use Case:**
  - An emergency braking system that must react immediately upon receiving a brake signal.

#### **Queue Management**
- **Description:** 
  - The RTE manages a **dedicated receive queue** for each receiver SWC, ensuring that data instances are processed in the order they were received.
  - The queue maintains the sequence of events, allowing receivers to process data deterministically.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Ordered Processing:** Preserves the sequence of data, which is essential for maintaining data integrity.
  - **Concurrent Access:** Supports multiple senders and receivers without data loss or corruption.
- **Example Use Case:**
  - A navigation system processing a stream of location updates from multiple GPS modules.

### 1.2 Data Consistency

Data consistency is paramount in ensuring that SWCs operate on reliable and accurate information. Queued S/R Communication implements mechanisms to maintain data integrity across multiple data instances and SWCs.

#### **Separate Event Handling**
- **Description:** 
  - Each data instance in the receive queue is treated as a distinct event, ensuring that no data overwrites or intermediate values are lost.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Integrity:** Prevents data corruption by maintaining discrete data instances.
  - **Traceability:** Facilitates tracking and debugging by preserving the history of data exchanges.
- **Example Use Case:**
  - An airbag deployment system that processes multiple crash event signals sequentially.

#### **Data Availability Until Consumption**
- **Description:** 
  - Data remains in the receive queue until it is explicitly consumed by the receiver SWC.
  - This guarantees that all data instances are processed, even if multiple events occur in rapid succession.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Reliability:** Ensures that no data is inadvertently discarded, maintaining comprehensive data processing.
  - **Flexibility:** Allows receivers to process data at their own pace without missing critical information.
- **Example Use Case:**
  - A vehicle stability control system that processes a series of sensor inputs over time.

### 1.3 Timeout Handling

Timeout handling is a critical feature that ensures system responsiveness and prevents indefinite blocking in waiting receive scenarios.

#### **Configurable Timeouts**
- **Description:** 
  - Waiting receive operations can be configured with specific timeout values, defining how long the receiver SWC should wait for data before proceeding.
- **Advantages:**
  - **System Responsiveness:** Prevents the receiver from being blocked indefinitely, ensuring that the system can handle situations where data may not arrive as expected.
  - **Error Handling:** Enables the implementation of fallback mechanisms or error reporting when data is not received within the stipulated time.
- **Example Use Case:**
  - A backup camera system that alerts the driver if no image data is received within a certain timeframe.

## 2. Communication Workflow

Understanding the communication workflow is essential for implementing Queued Sender/Receiver Communication effectively. The workflow delineates the interactions between sender and receiver SWCs, the RTE, and the Communication Stack (COM) within the Basic Software (BSW).

### 2.1 Send Operation

The send operation involves the sender SWC generating and transmitting data to the receiver SWC via the RTE and COM stack.

#### **Process Flow:**

1. **Sender Runnable Execution:**
   - The sender SWC's Runnable generates or updates the data that needs to be communicated.
   - It invokes the `Rte_Send` API to enqueue the data into the receive queue.

2. **RTE Processing:**
   - The RTE appends the new data instance to the tail of the dedicated receive queue.
   - Ensures that the data is stored in the correct sequence for ordered processing.

3. **COM Stack Transmission:**
   - The COM module in the BSW of the sender ECU handles the transmission of the queued data over the network bus (e.g., CAN, LIN, Ethernet).
   - Manages protocol-specific tasks to ensure reliable data delivery to the target ECU.

#### **Example Sender Code:**

```c
// Sender SWC writes temperature data to the receive queue
void SendTemperatureData(int32_t temperature) {
    Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Send_TemperatureSensor_Temperature(temperature);
    if (status != E_OK) {
        // Handle send failure (e.g., log error, implement retry mechanism)
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The sender SWC calculates the current temperature and sends it to the RTE using `Rte_Send_TemperatureSensor_Temperature`.
- Error handling ensures that any issues during the send operation are appropriately managed.

### 2.2 Receive Operation

The receive operation involves the receiver SWC retrieving and processing data from the receive queue managed by the RTE.

#### **Process Flow:**

1. **Receiver Runnable Invocation:**
   - The receiver SWC's Runnable is triggered based on predefined events (e.g., timer interrupts, data reception events).
   - Depending on the receive mode (polling or waiting), the Runnable either periodically checks the queue or blocks until data arrives.

2. **Data Retrieval:**
   - The Runnable invokes the `Rte_Receive` API to dequeue the next available data instance from the receive queue.
   - The RTE pops the data from the head of the queue, ensuring ordered processing.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - The receiver SWC processes the retrieved data to perform its designated function (e.g., adjusting climate control settings based on temperature data).

#### **Example Receiver Code:**

```c
// Receiver SWC reads temperature data from the receive queue
void ReceiveAndProcessTemperatureData(void) {
    int32_t receivedTemperature;
    Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Receive_TemperatureSensor_Temperature(&receivedTemperature);
    if (status == E_OK) {
        // Adjust climate control based on received temperature
        AdjustClimateControl(receivedTemperature);
    } else {
        // Handle receive failure (e.g., default behavior, log error)
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The receiver SWC reads the latest temperature data from the RTE using `Rte_Receive_TemperatureSensor_Temperature`.
- Upon successful retrieval, it adjusts the climate control system accordingly.
- Error handling ensures that any issues during the receive operation are appropriately managed.

int32_t currentTemperature = 25;
Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Send_TemperatureSensor_Temperature(currentTemperature);
if (status != E_OK) {
    // Handle send failure (e.g., log error, implement retry mechanism)
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The sender SWC sends the current temperature to the receive queue using `Rte_Send_TemperatureSensor_Temperature`.
- Error handling ensures that any issues during the send operation are appropriately managed.

### 3.2 Rte_Receive

#### **Example:**

```c
// Receiving temperature data from the receive queue
int32_t receivedTemperature;
Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Receive_TemperatureSensor_Temperature(&receivedTemperature);
if (status == E_OK) {
    // Use the received temperature to adjust climate control
    AdjustClimateControl(receivedTemperature);
} else {
    // Handle receive failure (e.g., default behavior, log error)
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The receiver SWC reads the latest temperature data from the receive queue using `Rte_Receive_TemperatureSensor_Temperature`.
- Upon successful retrieval, it adjusts the climate control system accordingly.
- Error handling ensures that any issues during the receive operation are appropriately managed.
