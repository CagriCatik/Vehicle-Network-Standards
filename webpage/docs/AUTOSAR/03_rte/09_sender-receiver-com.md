# Sender/Receiver Communication: Data Element Invalidation

In the **AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture)** framework, **Data Element Invalidation** is a critical mechanism within the **Sender/Receiver (S/R) Communication** paradigm. This feature ensures the robust handling of invalid or erroneous data values, thereby enhancing system reliability and safety. By marking data elements as invalid when unreliable data is detected, AUTOSAR facilitates appropriate reactions from receiver Software Components (SWCs), preventing the propagation of faulty information and maintaining overall system integrity.

## 1. Overview

### What is Data Element Invalidation?

**Data Element Invalidation** is a mechanism designed to **mark data elements as invalid** within the AUTOSAR Sender/Receiver communication framework. This process is triggered when the sender SWC detects erroneous or unreliable data, such as malfunctioning sensors or out-of-range values. By invalidating these data elements, the system ensures that receiver SWCs are aware of the data's unreliable state and can respond appropriately, thereby maintaining system safety and reliability.

- **Purpose:**
  - **Error Detection:** Identifies and flags invalid or erroneous data.
  - **System Integrity:** Prevents the use of unreliable data in critical system operations.
  - **Safety Enhancement:** Ensures that safety-critical applications do not act on faulty information.

## 2. Use Case

**Typical Scenario:**

Consider a **sensor module** responsible for monitoring the temperature within an engine compartment. If the sensor malfunctions or delivers a temperature value outside the expected range (e.g., due to a hardware fault or environmental interference), the system must recognize this anomaly to prevent erroneous actions, such as improper cooling or overheating responses.

- **Applicability:** 
  - **Non-Queued Communication (`isQueued=false`):** Data Element Invalidation is primarily applicable to non-queued communication scenarios where only the latest data value is critical, and historical data is not retained.

- **Example:**
  - A **Temperature Sensor SWC** detects an out-of-range temperature value and marks it as invalid to prevent the **Engine Control SWC** from making incorrect adjustments based on unreliable data.

## 3. How Data Element Invalidation Works

Data Element Invalidation involves both sender and receiver SWCs, orchestrated by the **Runtime Environment (RTE)**. The process ensures that invalid data is appropriately flagged and handled, maintaining system reliability.

### 3.1 Sender-Side Invalidation

**Sender-Side Invalidation** is the process by which the sender SWC marks a data element as invalid when it detects unreliable or erroneous data.

- **Mechanism:**
  - The sender SWC invokes the `Rte_Invalidate_<p>_<d>()` API to mark a specific data element as invalid.
  - This action updates the RTE's shared data buffer, signaling to all receiver SWCs that the current data is unreliable.

- **API Usage:**

  ```c
  void Rte_Invalidate_<p>_<d>(void);
  ```

  - **Parameters:**
    - None.
  - **Effect:**
    - Marks the specified data element as invalid within the RTE's shared buffer.

- **Code Example:**

  ```c
  // Invalidate the temperature data due to sensor malfunction
  Rte_Invalidate_Sensor_Temperature();
  ```

  **Explanation:**
  - The `Rte_Invalidate_Sensor_Temperature` function is called when the temperature sensor detects an anomaly.
  - This marks the `Temperature` data element as invalid, notifying all receivers of its unreliable state.

### 3.2 Receiver-Side Reaction

**Receiver-Side Reaction** involves the receiver SWC detecting the invalidation of a data element and responding appropriately to maintain system safety and reliability.

- **Mechanism:**
  - The receiver SWC evaluates the return value of its read operation to determine if the data is valid.
  - Depending on the communication model (direct or buffered), different APIs and return values are used to check for invalid data.

- **Direct Communication:**
  - The `Rte_Read_<p>_<d>()` function returns `RTE_E_INVALID` if the data element is marked as invalid.

- **Buffered Communication:**
  - The `Rte_IStatus_<re>_<p>_<d>()` function indicates the invalidation status of the data element.

- **API Usage:**

  1. **Direct Communication:**

     ```c
     Std_ReturnType Rte_Read_<p>_<d>(OUT <DataType> *data);
     ```

     - **Returns:**
       - `RTE_E_OK`: Successful read with valid data.
       - `RTE_E_INVALID`: Data element is marked as invalid.

  2. **Buffered Communication:**

     ```c
     Std_ReturnType Rte_IStatus_<re>_<p>_<d>(void);
     ```

     - **Returns:**
       - `RTE_E_OK`: Data is valid.
       - `RTE_E_INVALID`: Data is invalid.

- **Code Examples:**

  1. **Direct Communication:**

     ```c
     // Receiver SWC reads the temperature data
     int32_t temperature;
     Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Read_Sensor_Temperature(&temperature);

     if (status == RTE_E_INVALID) {
         // Handle invalid temperature data
         ActivateSafetyMode();
     } else if (status == RTE_E_OK) {
         // Process valid temperature data
         AdjustCoolingSystem(temperature);
     }
     ```

     **Explanation:**
     - The receiver SWC attempts to read the temperature data.
     - If the data is invalid (`RTE_E_INVALID`), it activates a safety mode to prevent unsafe operations.
     - If the data is valid (`RTE_E_OK`), it proceeds with normal processing.

  2. **Buffered Communication:**

     ```c
     // Receiver SWC checks the status of the temperature data
     Std_ReturnType status = Rte_IStatus_SensorModule_Temperature();

     if (status == RTE_E_INVALID) {
         // Handle invalid temperature data
         ActivateSafetyMode();
     } else if (status == RTE_E_OK) {
         // Proceed to read and process valid temperature data
         int32_t temperature = Rte_IRead_SensorModule_Temperature();
         AdjustCoolingSystem(temperature);
     }
     ```

     **Explanation:**
     - The receiver SWC first checks if the temperature data is valid using `Rte_IStatus_SensorModule_Temperature`.
     - If invalid, it activates safety protocols.
     - If valid, it reads and processes the temperature data accordingly.

## 4. Additional Mechanisms

### Activation of Runnables

In addition to invalidating data elements, AUTOSAR provides mechanisms to activate specific Runnables in response to data invalidation events. This allows the system to handle errors proactively and maintain robust operation.

- **DataReceiveErrorEvent:**
  - **Description:** An event that triggers a dedicated Runnable when invalid data is detected.
  - **Usage:** Configured within the RTE to activate error-handling Runnables upon data invalidation.
  
- **Configuration Example:**
  
  ```xml
  <EventMapping>
      <Event id="DataReceiveErrorEvent_Sensor_Temperature">
          <RunnableRef>HandleTemperatureError</RunnableRef>
      </Event>
  </EventMapping>
  ```

- **Code Example:**

  ```c
  // Error-handling Runnable for temperature data invalidation
  void HandleTemperatureError(void) {
      // Log the error
      LogError("Temperature data is invalid.");

      // Trigger safety mechanisms
      ActivateSafetyMode();
  }
  ```

  **Explanation:**
  - When the temperature data is invalidated, the `DataReceiveErrorEvent_Sensor_Temperature` event is triggered.
  - This activates the `HandleTemperatureError` Runnable, which logs the error and activates safety protocols.
