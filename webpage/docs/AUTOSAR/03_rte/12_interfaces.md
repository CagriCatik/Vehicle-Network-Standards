## 4. Standardized AUTOSAR Interfaces

### **Sender/Receiver Communication**

Facilitates data exchange between SWCs where one SWC (Sender) provides data to another SWC (Receiver) without expecting an immediate response.

- **RTE APIs:**
  - **Rte_Write:** Used by the Sender SWC to send data.
    ```c
    Std_ReturnType Rte_Write_<Port>_<Data>(<DataType> data);
    ```
  - **Rte_Read:** Used by the Receiver SWC to read data.
    ```c
    Std_ReturnType Rte_Read_<Port>_<Data>(<DataType> *data);
    ```

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Sender SWC: Writing sensor data
  void SendSensorData(int32_t sensorValue) {
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Write_SensorData_SensorValue(sensorValue);
      if (status != E_OK) {
          // Handle write failure
      }
  }

  // Receiver SWC: Reading sensor data
  void ReceiveSensorData(void) {
      int32_t receivedValue;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Read_SensorData_SensorValue(&receivedValue);
      if (status == E_OK) {
          // Process receivedValue
      } else {
          // Handle read failure
      }
  }
  ```

### **Client/Server Communication**

Enables one SWC (Client) to request services or operations from another SWC (Server), allowing for more complex interactions such as operation invocation and result retrieval.

#### **Synchronous Communication**

- **Description:**
  - The client SWC is blocked until the server SWC completes the requested operation.
  - Immediate response is returned via `OUT` parameters.

- **RTE API:**
  ```c
  Std_ReturnType Rte_Call_<Port>_<Operation>(
      IN <ParamType1> param1,
      IN/OUT <ParamType2> param2,
      OUT <ParamType3> param3
  );
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType GetTime(uint32 *hour, uint32 *minute, uint32 *second) {
      if (hour == NULL || minute == NULL || second == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      *hour = SystemClock_GetHour();
      *minute = SystemClock_GetMinute();
      *second = SystemClock_GetSecond();
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC Invocation
  void RequestCurrentTime(void) {
      uint32 hour, minute, second;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_TimeService_GetTime(&hour, &minute, &second);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          DisplayTime(hour, minute, second);
      } else {
          DisplayTime(0, 0, 0); // Default or error state
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Asynchronous Communication**

- **Description:**
  - The client SWC continues execution without waiting for the server to complete the operation.
  - Results are provided later, either through polling or callback mechanisms.

- **RTE APIs:**
  - **Rte_Call:** Initiates the asynchronous operation.
    ```c
    Std_ReturnType Rte_Call_<Port>_<Operation>(
        IN <ParamType1> param1,
        IN/OUT <ParamType2> param2
    );
    ```
  - **Rte_Result:** Retrieves the result of the asynchronous operation.
    ```c
    Std_ReturnType Rte_Result_<Port>_<Operation>(
        OUT <ResultType> result
    );
    ```

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType ProcessData(int32 inputData, int32 *outputData) {
      if (outputData == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      *outputData = inputData * 2;
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC Invocation
  void RequestDataProcessing(int32 data) {
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_DataService_ProcessData(data, NULL);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          // Continue with other tasks
      } else {
          // Handle the error
      }
  }

  void RetrieveProcessedData(void) {
      int32 processedData;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Result_DataService_ProcessData(&processedData);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          UtilizeProcessedData(processedData);
      } else {
          UtilizeProcessedData(0); // Default or error state
      }
  }
  ```

## 8. Practical Use-Cases

AUTOSAR Interfaces are versatile and cater to a wide array of application scenarios within automotive systems. Below are some prominent use-cases that demonstrate the efficacy of this communication paradigm.

### 8.1 Time Query

- **Scenario:**
  - A client SWC needs to obtain the current system time from a server SWC responsible for maintaining the real-time clock.

- **Communication Mode:**
  - **Synchronous:** When the client requires the time immediately to proceed with critical operations.
  - **Asynchronous:** When the client can continue executing other tasks and retrieve the time later.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType GetTime(uint32 *hour, uint32 *minute, uint32 *second) {
      if (hour == NULL || minute == NULL || second == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      *hour = SystemClock_GetHour();
      *minute = SystemClock_GetMinute();
      *second = SystemClock_GetSecond();
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC: Synchronous time request
  void DisplayCurrentTime(void) {
      uint32 hour, minute, second;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_TimeService_GetTime(&hour, &minute, &second);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          DisplayTime(hour, minute, second);
      } else {
          DisplayTime(0, 0, 0); // Default or error state
      }
  }

  // Client SWC: Asynchronous time request
  void RequestCurrentTimeAsync(void) {
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_TimeService_GetTime(NULL, NULL, NULL);
      if (status == E_OK) {
          // Continue with other tasks
      } else {
          // Handle error
      }
  }

  void RetrieveTimeAsync(void) {
      uint32 hour, minute, second;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Result_TimeService_GetTime(&hour, &minute, &second);
      if (status == E_OK) {
          DisplayTime(hour, minute, second);
      } else {
          DisplayTime(0, 0, 0); // Default or error state
      }
  }
  ```

### 8.2 Sensor-Actuator Coordination

- **Scenario:**
  - An actuator SWC needs to perform actions based on processed data provided by a sensor SWC.

- **Communication Mode:**
  - **Asynchronous:** Ensures that the actuator can continue its operations without being blocked by data processing tasks.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType ProcessSensorData(int32 inputData, int32 *outputData) {
      if (outputData == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      *outputData = inputData * 2; // Example processing
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC: Actuator requesting processed sensor data asynchronously
  void ActivateActuator(int32 rawData) {
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_SensorService_ProcessSensorData(rawData, NULL);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          // Continue with other tasks while processing
      } else {
          // Handle error (e.g., log error, set default behavior)
      }
  }

  void RetrieveActuatorData(void) {
      int32 processedData;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Result_SensorService_ProcessSensorData(&processedData);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          ControlActuator(processedData);
      } else {
          ControlActuator(DEFAULT_VALUE);
      }
  }
  ```

### 8.3 Diagnostic Services

- **Scenario:**
  - A diagnostic SWC needs to retrieve system status or fault codes from a server SWC responsible for monitoring vehicle health.

- **Communication Mode:**
  - **Synchronous:** Ensures that diagnostic information is retrieved promptly for immediate analysis or reporting.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType GetFaultCodes(FaultCodeType *faultCodes) {
      if (faultCodes == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      // Retrieve fault codes from the system
      SystemDiagnostics_GetFaultCodes(faultCodes);
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC: Diagnostic SWC requesting fault codes synchronously
  void RetrieveFaultCodes(void) {
      FaultCodeType faultCodes[MAX_FAULTS];
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_DiagnosticService_GetFaultCodes(faultCodes);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          ProcessFaultCodes(faultCodes);
      } else {
          // Handle error (e.g., log, notify)
      }
  }
  ```

### 8.4 Configuration Management

- **Scenario:**
  - A configuration SWC needs to retrieve or update system parameters managed by a configuration server SWC.

- **Communication Mode:**
  - **Both Synchronous and Asynchronous:** Depending on whether immediate confirmation is required.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType UpdateParameters(ParameterType newParams, ConfirmationType *confirmation) {
      if (confirmation == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      // Update system parameters
      SystemConfig_Update(newParams);
      confirmation->success = TRUE;
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC: Configuration SWC updating system parameters asynchronously
  void UpdateSystemParameters(ParameterType newParams) {
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_ConfigService_UpdateParameters(newParams, NULL);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          // Continue with other tasks
      } else {
          // Handle error (e.g., retry, log)
      }
      
      // Optionally, retrieve confirmation
      ConfirmationType confirmation;
      status = Rte_Result_ConfigService_UpdateParameters(&confirmation);
      
      if (status == E_OK && confirmation.success) {

  }
  ```

### 8.5 User Interface Interaction

- **Scenario:**
  - A user interface SWC (e.g., infotainment system) requests the current status or configuration from a server SWC (e.g., climate control system).

- **Communication Mode:**
  - **Synchronous:** When the interface needs to display current status immediately upon user request.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType GetClimateStatus(ClimateStatusType *status) {
      if (status == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      *status = ClimateControl_GetStatus();
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC: Infotainment SWC requesting climate control status synchronously
  void ShowClimateControlStatus(void) {
      ClimateStatusType status;
      Std_ReturnType result = Rte_Call_ClimateService_GetClimateStatus(&status);
      
      if (result == E_OK) {
          DisplayClimateStatus(status);
      } else {
          DisplayClimateStatus(DEFAULT_STATUS);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Actuator SWC:** Adjusts the cooling system based on processed temperature data.

### **11.2 Communication Mode**

- **Synchronous:** For immediate adjustments when critical temperature changes are detected.
- **Asynchronous:** For periodic adjustments where immediate response is not critical.

### **11.3 Implementation Steps**

#### **11.3.1 Sensor SWC: Sending Temperature Data (Sender/Receiver Communication)**

// Sender SWC: TemperatureSensor.c
void TemperatureSensor_ReadAndSend(void) {
    int32_t rawTemperature = ReadRawTemperature();
    Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Write_TemperatureService_Temperature(rawTemperature);
    
    if (status != E_OK) {
        // Handle write failure (e.g., log error, set default behavior)
        LogError("Failed to send temperature data.");
    }
}
```

#### **11.3.2 Actuator SWC: Receiving Temperature Data**

```c
// Receiver SWC: CoolingSystem.c
void CoolingSystem_AdjustTemperature(void) {
    int32_t receivedTemperature;
    Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Read_TemperatureService_Temperature(&receivedTemperature);
    
    if (status == E_OK) {
        AdjustCoolingMechanism(receivedTemperature);
    } else {
        // Handle read failure (e.g., set default cooling level, log error)
        AdjustCoolingMechanism(DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE);
    }
}
```

#### **11.3.3 Actuator SWC: Requesting Detailed Status (Client/Server Communication - Synchronous)**

// Server SWC: CoolingSystem.c
Std_ReturnType GetCoolingStatus(CoolingStatusType *status) {
    if (status == NULL) {
        return E_NOT_OK;
    }
    *status = CurrentCoolingStatus();
    return E_OK;
}

// Client SWC: Dashboard.c
void DisplayCoolingStatus(void) {
    CoolingStatusType status;
    Std_ReturnType result = Rte_Call_CoolingService_GetCoolingStatus(&status);
    
    if (result == E_OK) {
        UpdateDashboardDisplay(status);
    } else {
        // Handle error (e.g., display default status, notify user)
        UpdateDashboardDisplay(DEFAULT_STATUS);
    }
}
```

    |--- Rte_Read_Temperature(&Y) -->|                            |
    |                              |--- Retrieve X from Queue ----|
    |<--- Receive Y = X ----------|                            |
    |                              |                            |
    |--- AdjustCooling(Y) -------->|                            |

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sensor SWC** reads the raw temperature and sends it to the **RTE** using `Rte_Write_Temperature`.
2. The **RTE** stores the temperature data in a receive queue.
3. **Actuator SWC** invokes `Rte_Read_Temperature` to retrieve the latest temperature data.
4. The **RTE** retrieves the temperature data from the queue and provides it to the **Actuator SWC**.
5. The **Actuator SWC** processes the temperature data to adjust the cooling system accordingly.

### **11.5 Benefits Illustrated**

- **Modularity:** Sensor and actuator functionalities are encapsulated within separate SWCs, promoting separation of concerns.
- **Scalability:** Additional sensors or actuators can be integrated without altering existing communication flows.
- **Reusability:** The cooling system SWC can be reused in different vehicle models with minimal modifications.
