## 4. API Examples

### **Sender/Receiver Communication**

Facilitates data exchange between SWCs where one SWC (Sender) provides data to another SWC (Receiver) without expecting an immediate response.

- **RTE APIs:**
  - **Rte_Write:** Used by the Sender SWC to send data.
    ```c
    Std_ReturnType Rte_Write_<Port>_<Data>(<DataType> data);
    ```
  - **Rte_Read:** Used by the Receiver SWC to read data.
    ```c
    Std_ReturnType Rte_Read_<Port>_<Data>(<DataType> *data);
    ```

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Sender SWC: Writing sensor data
  void SendSensorData(int32_t sensorValue) {
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Write_SensorData_SensorValue(sensorValue);
      if (status != E_OK) {
          // Handle write failure
          LogError("Failed to send sensor data.");
      }
  }

  // Receiver SWC: Reading sensor data
  void ReceiveSensorData(void) {
      int32_t receivedValue;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Read_SensorData_SensorValue(&receivedValue);
      if (status == E_OK) {
          // Process receivedValue
          ProcessSensorData(receivedValue);
      } else {
          // Handle read failure
          HandleReadError();
      }
  }
  ```

### **Client/Server Communication**

Enables one SWC (Client) to request services or operations from another SWC (Server), allowing for more complex interactions such as operation invocation and result retrieval.

#### **Synchronous Communication**

- **Description:**
  - The client SWC is blocked until the server SWC completes the requested operation.
  - Immediate response is returned via `OUT` parameters.

- **RTE API:**
  ```c
  Std_ReturnType Rte_Call_<PortPrototype>_<Operation>(
      IN <ParamType1> param1,
      IN/OUT <ParamType2> param2,
      OUT <ParamType3> param3
  );
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType GetTime(uint32 *hour, uint32 *minute, uint32 *second) {
      if (hour == NULL || minute == NULL || second == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      *hour = SystemClock_GetHour();
      *minute = SystemClock_GetMinute();
      *second = SystemClock_GetSecond();
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC Invocation
  void RequestCurrentTime(void) {
      uint32 hour, minute, second;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_TimeService_GetTime(&hour, &minute, &second);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          DisplayTime(hour, minute, second);
      } else {
          DisplayTime(0, 0, 0); // Default or error state
      }
  }
  ```

#### **Asynchronous Communication**

- **Description:**
  - The client SWC continues execution without waiting for the server to complete the operation.
  - Results are provided later, either through polling or callback mechanisms.

- **RTE APIs:**
  - **Rte_Call:** Initiates the asynchronous operation.
    ```c
    Std_ReturnType Rte_Call_<Port>_<Operation>(
        IN <ParamType1> param1,
        IN/OUT <ParamType2> param2
    );
    ```
  - **Rte_Result:** Retrieves the result of the asynchronous operation.
    ```c
    Std_ReturnType Rte_Result_<Port>_<Operation>(
        OUT <ResultType> result
    );
    ```

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType ProcessData(int32 inputData, int32 *outputData) {
      if (outputData == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      *outputData = inputData * 2; // Example processing
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC Invocation
  void RequestDataProcessing(int32 data) {
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_DataService_ProcessData(data, NULL);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          // Continue with other tasks
      } else {
          // Handle the error (e.g., log error, set default behavior)
      }
  }

  void RetrieveProcessedData(void) {
      int32 processedData;
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Result_DataService_ProcessData(&processedData);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          UtilizeProcessedData(processedData);
      } else {
          UtilizeProcessedData(0); // Default or error state
      }
  }
  ```

      // Update system parameters
      SystemConfig_Update(newParams);
      confirmation->success = TRUE;
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC: Configuration SWC updating system parameters asynchronously
  void UpdateSystemParameters(ParameterType newParams) {
      Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Call_ConfigService_UpdateParameters(newParams, NULL);
      
      if (status == E_OK) {
          // Continue with other tasks
      } else {
          // Handle error (e.g., retry, log)
      }
      
      // Optionally, retrieve confirmation
      ConfirmationType confirmation;
      status = Rte_Result_ConfigService_UpdateParameters(&confirmation);
      
      if (status == E_OK && confirmation.success) {
          // Acknowledge successful update
      } else {

  - A user interface SWC (e.g., infotainment system) requests the current status or configuration from a server SWC (e.g., climate control system).

- **Communication Mode:**
  - **Synchronous:** When the interface needs to display current status immediately upon user request.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  // Server Runnable Implementation
  Std_ReturnType GetClimateStatus(ClimateStatusType *status) {
      if (status == NULL) {
          return E_NOT_OK;
      }
      *status = ClimateControl_GetStatus();
      return E_OK;
  }

  // Client SWC: Infotainment SWC requesting climate control status synchronously
  void ShowClimateControlStatus(void) {
      ClimateStatusType status;
      Std_ReturnType result = Rte_Call_ClimateService_GetClimateStatus(&status);
      
      if (result == E_OK) {
          DisplayClimateStatus(status);
      } else {
          DisplayClimateStatus(DEFAULT_STATUS);
      }
  }
  ```

## 9. Implementation Guidelines

Implementing the **Standardized AUTOSAR Interface** effectively requires a structured approach, ensuring that both client and server SWCs are correctly configured and that the RTE facilitates seamless interactions. Below are key guidelines and best practices to consider during implementation.

### 9.1 Defining Operation Interfaces

- **Service Interfaces:**
  - Clearly define the operations provided by server SWCs, including input and output parameters.
  - Utilize AUTOSAR's tooling to create operation descriptors that outline the communication interfaces between clients and servers.

- **Operation Descriptors:**
  - Define operation interfaces in the SWC's Software Component Description (SWC-SD) using AUTOSAR's XML-based description language.
  - Specify details such as operation names, parameter types, and communication semantics.

### 9.2 Configuring RTE Ports

- **Ports and Interfaces:**
  - Configure RTE ports for both client and server SWCs, specifying whether they are client or server ports.
  - Use required ports for client SWCs and provided ports for server SWCs.

- **Port Types:**
  - **Required Ports:** Define the services or data a SWC needs from others.
  - **Provided Ports:** Define the services or data a SWC offers to others.

### 9.3 Handling Synchronous Operations

- **Blocking Calls:**

### **11.1 Scenario**

- **Sensor SWC:** Captures raw temperature data from an engine sensor.
- **Actuator SWC:** Adjusts the cooling system based on processed temperature data.

### **11.2 Communication Mode**

- **Synchronous:** For immediate adjustments when critical temperature changes are detected.
- **Asynchronous:** For periodic adjustments where immediate response is not critical.

### **11.3 Implementation Steps**

```c
// Sender SWC: TemperatureSensor.c
void TemperatureSensor_ReadAndSend(void) {
    int32_t rawTemperature = ReadRawTemperature();
    Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Write_TemperatureService_Temperature(rawTemperature);
    
    if (status != E_OK) {
        // Handle write failure (e.g., log error, set default behavior)
        LogError("Failed to send temperature data.");
    }
}
```

#### **11.3.2 Actuator SWC: Receiving Temperature Data**

void CoolingSystem_AdjustTemperature(void) {
    int32_t receivedTemperature;
    Std_ReturnType status = Rte_Read_TemperatureService_Temperature(&receivedTemperature);
    
    if (status == E_OK) {
        AdjustCoolingMechanism(receivedTemperature);
    } else {
        // Handle read failure (e.g., set default cooling level, log error)
        AdjustCoolingMechanism(DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE);
    }
}
```

#### **11.3.3 Actuator SWC: Requesting Detailed Status (Client/Server Communication - Synchronous)**

```c
// Server SWC: CoolingSystem.c
Std_ReturnType GetCoolingStatus(CoolingStatusType *status) {
    if (status == NULL) {
        return E_NOT_OK;
    }
    *status = CurrentCoolingStatus();
    return E_OK;
}

// Client SWC: Dashboard.c
void DisplayCoolingStatus(void) {
    CoolingStatusType status;
    Std_ReturnType result = Rte_Call_CoolingService_GetCoolingStatus(&status);
    
    if (result == E_OK) {
        UpdateDashboardDisplay(status);
    } else {
        // Handle error (e.g., display default status, notify user)
