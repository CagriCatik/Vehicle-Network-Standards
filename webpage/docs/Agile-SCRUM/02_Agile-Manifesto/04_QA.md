- **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**
- **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**

These values serve as the foundation for all Agile practices, emphasizing human collaboration, practical results, and adaptability.

---

## Why is 'Individuals and Interactions' valued over 'Processes and Tools'?

'Individuals and Interactions' is valued over 'Processes and Tools' because it underscores the importance of effective communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders. While processes and tools are important, they should serve to enhance human interactions rather than replace them. This focus helps reduce misunderstandings and increases the team's ability to quickly adapt to changes.

---

## What is the primary goal when prioritizing 'Working Software' over 'Comprehensive Documentation'?

The primary goal is to produce **working software** that meets user needs. While documentation is still important, its role is to support development rather than delay it. By focusing on delivering functional software, teams can obtain early feedback and iterate rapidly, ensuring that the end product is valuable and aligned with customer expectations.

---

## How does 'Customer Collaboration' differ from 'Contract Negotiation' in Agile values?

In Agile, **Customer Collaboration** emphasizes ongoing, active engagement with customers to understand and meet their evolving needs. This approach contrasts with **Contract Negotiation**, which often involves rigid, predefined terms that can hinder flexibility. Agile prefers a dynamic relationship where the focus is on achieving customer satisfaction through continuous dialogue and iterative improvement.

---

## What does 'Responding to Change' emphasize over 'Following a Plan'?

'Responding to Change' emphasizes the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the development process. Unlike strictly following a predetermined plan, Agile values the ability to pivot and adjust to new information, market conditions, or customer feedback. This adaptability ensures that the project remains relevant and can capitalize on emerging opportunities.

---

## What is the first principle that supports Agile values?

The first principle is: **"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."**  
This principle underlines the commitment to delivering functional software early and frequently, ensuring that the customer receives immediate value and feedback is incorporated throughout the development cycle.

---

## How does Agile handle changing requirements according to its principles?

Agile welcomes changing requirements—even late in the development process—as a means to harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. By embracing change, Agile teams can continuously adjust and improve the product based on the latest insights and market demands.

---

## What is the preferred timescale for delivering working software in Agile?

Agile prefers **shorter timescales** for the delivery of working software. Typically, functional software is delivered every few weeks (often two to four weeks), which helps maintain momentum and allows for frequent feedback and iterative improvements.

---

## Why is daily collaboration between business people and developers important in Agile?

Daily collaboration ensures **continuous alignment and understanding** between business stakeholders and development teams. This regular interaction minimizes misunderstandings, allows for the immediate resolution of issues, and ensures that both sides remain focused on delivering a product that meets customer needs.

---

## What environment is necessary for motivated individuals in Agile projects?

Agile projects should be built around **motivated individuals**, providing them with the right environment and support. This includes a culture of trust, empowerment, and autonomy, where team members are encouraged to take initiative and are given the resources necessary to innovate and solve problems.

---

## What is the most efficient method of conveying information within an Agile development team?

**Face-to-face conversation** is considered the most efficient and effective method of conveying information within an Agile development team. Direct communication minimizes misinterpretation and enables immediate feedback, ensuring that all team members have a clear and shared understanding of project requirements and progress.

---

## What is the primary measure of progress in Agile?

In Agile, the primary measure of progress is **working software**. Rather than relying on documentation or intermediate deliverables, progress is assessed based on the functionality and usability of the software being developed.

---

## What does sustainable development mean in Agile processes?

**Sustainable development** in Agile means that the pace of work is maintained at a constant, manageable rate. Agile processes are designed so that sponsors, developers, and users can sustain their effort indefinitely without burnout, ensuring long-term productivity and consistent delivery of value.

---
