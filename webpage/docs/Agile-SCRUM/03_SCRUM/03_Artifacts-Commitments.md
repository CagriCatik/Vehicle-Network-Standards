# Artifacts & Commitments

This documentation offers a detailed examination of Scrum artifacts and their associated commitments, which are essential for ensuring transparency, focus, and measurable progress. By understanding these key components, teams can better manage complex projects, maintain alignment, and deliver high-quality products consistently.

## Introduction

In Scrum, artifacts are the tangible outputs that provide essential information about the product and the work being done. Along with these artifacts, specific commitments are established to ensure that the team remains focused and aligned with both short-term and long-term goals. Together, these elements promote transparency and provide a clear mechanism for measuring progress.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum defines three primary artifacts, each designed to maximize transparency and provide a clear understanding of the work:

### 1. Product Backlog

**Description:**  
The Product Backlog is a dynamic, ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product. It serves as the single source of requirements for any changes or new features and evolves as the product and market needs change.

- **Structure:**  
  - **Top of the Backlog:** Contains the most refined and prioritized Product Backlog Items (PBIs) that are ready for upcoming Sprints.
  - **Middle of the Backlog:** Contains moderately refined PBIs, providing more detailed requirements that are under active consideration.
  - **Bottom of the Backlog:** Holds rough, high-level requirements or ideas that have yet to be refined.

- **Example:**  
  If a stakeholder proposes building a new website, the Product Owner works with the Scrum Team to translate this idea into a specific Product Goal, such as "creation of a new website." The related PBIs are then added to the Product Backlog and refined over time.

- **Commitment:**  
  The Product Backlog’s commitment is the **Product Goal**. Only one Product Goal is active at any given time, providing long-term direction and vision for the product.

### 2. Sprint Backlog

**Description:**  
The Sprint Backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog. It includes the PBIs selected for the current Sprint along with a detailed plan for delivering the product Increment and achieving the Sprint Goal.

- **Formation:**  
  During Sprint Planning, the Scrum Team collaborates to select PBIs from the Product Backlog that they believe can be completed during the Sprint. They also define a clear Sprint Goal, which unifies the team’s efforts.

- **Example:**  
  For a website creation project, the Sprint Goal might be “design of the basic structure of the website.” The corresponding PBIs for layout, navigation, and initial content would be selected and detailed in the Sprint Backlog.

- **Commitment:**  
  The Sprint Backlog’s commitment is the **Sprint Goal**, providing a clear, short-term objective for the team to focus on throughout the Sprint.

### 3. Increment

**Description:**  
The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog Items completed during a Sprint, combined with the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of each Sprint, the new Increment must be in a usable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s quality standards.

- **Definition of Done (DoD):**  
  The DoD is a shared understanding that defines what it means for work to be considered complete. It ensures that each Increment is of high quality, usable, and potentially shippable.

- **Commitment:**  
  The commitment for the Increment is the **Definition of Done**, which guarantees that every product increment is delivered with consistent quality and is ready for release.

## Measuring Progress

The commitments associated with each artifact play a critical role in measuring progress and ensuring that the team remains focused:

- **Sprint Review:**  
  At the end of each Sprint, the team inspects the Increment against the Sprint Goal. This meeting serves as a checkpoint to assess if the Sprint was successful and if the progress aligns with the Product Goal over multiple Sprints.

- **Transparency and Focus:**  
  The clear commitments—the Product Goal, Sprint Goal, and Definition of Done—ensure that every team member is aware of the current priorities and the long-term vision. This common understanding provides a solid basis for making informed decisions and adjusting strategies as needed.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Effective use of artifacts and commitments in Scrum is supported by clearly defined roles:

### 1. Product Owner (PO)

- **Key Responsibilities:**  
  - Manage and prioritize the Product Backlog.
  - Collaborate with stakeholders to understand and refine requirements.
  - Ensure that the team has a clear understanding of the PBIs.

### 2. Scrum Master

- **Key Responsibilities:**  
  - Coach the Scrum Team in Scrum practices and principles.
  - Facilitate Scrum events and help remove any impediments.
  - Support the team in becoming self-organizing and self-managing.

### 3. Developers

- **Key Responsibilities:**  
  - Develop the product Increment.
  - Participate actively in refining the Product Backlog and planning Sprints.
  - Ensure that the work meets the Definition of Done.

## Summary

Understanding and effectively implementing Scrum artifacts and commitments are essential for maintaining transparency, focus, and measurable progress in complex projects. The three key artifacts—the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment—each have a corresponding commitment (Product Goal, Sprint Goal, and Definition of Done) that drives the team’s efforts. Coupled with the defined roles within Scrum, these artifacts create a robust framework that supports the continuous delivery of high-quality products. By embracing these principles, teams can achieve better alignment, make informed decisions, and continuously improve their processes to deliver maximum value to their customers.
