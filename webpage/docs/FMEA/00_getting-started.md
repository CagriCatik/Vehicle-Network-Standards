# Getting Started

## Understanding FMEA  
- Learn the core concepts, terminology, and purpose of FMEA. 
- It is a systematic tool to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks in both product design and processes.

## Stage 1  
- Identify potential failure modes, which are the ways in which a component, product, or process could fail.
- Determine the possible effects of each failure on system performance and end users.

## Stage 2  
- Analyze the root causes of each failure mode. Assign severity ratings based on how critical the failureâ€™s impact would be. 
- This stage helps prioritize issues based on their potential harm.

## Stage 3  
- Evaluate the existing controls that prevent or detect failure modes. 
- Use this data to calculate Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs), which quantify the level of risk associated with each failure mode.

## Stage 4 & 5  
- Develop action plans aimed at reducing or eliminating the identified risks. 
- Implement these actions and reassess the severity, occurrence, and detection factors to calculate updated RPNs.

## Stage 6  
- Finalize the FMEA by documenting improvements and ensuring a process for continuous monitoring and review is in place. 
- This ensures long-term risk management and process optimization.

## Benefits and Shortcomings  
- Explore the benefits, such as improved product reliability, enhanced safety, and risk mitigation. 
- Also, understand limitations, like the time-consuming nature of the process and its reliance on expert input.

## Steps to Construct  
- Follow a structured step-by-step approach to create an effective FMEA. 
- This includes defining the scope, gathering the right team, performing risk analysis, and documenting results.

## Q&A  
- Review answers to frequently asked questions, expert insights, and troubleshooting tips for common challenges encountered during FMEA implementation.
