# The History of FMEA

## Introduction

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic method used for identifying potential failure modes in a system, product, or process, assessing their effects on overall system performance, and prioritizing corrective actions to mitigate the risks associated with those failures. FMEA is a fundamental tool in reliability engineering and quality management, playing a critical role in enhancing the safety, reliability, and robustness of products and processes across various industries.

The origins of FMEA can be traced back to more than six decades ago, with its initial development rooted in military and aerospace applications. The following timeline provides a detailed overview of the evolution of FMEA:

### 1940s: Military Beginnings

FMEA was first formally described in the 1940s in the U.S. Armed Military Procedures document. The military's primary concern was ensuring the reliability and safety of complex systems used in defense operations. The systematic approach of FMEA was deemed essential for identifying and mitigating potential failures in these critical systems.

### 1960s: NASA's Adoption

During the 1960s, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began employing variations of FMEA under different names. Contractors working on space missions needed a reliable method to ensure the safety and success of their missions, which led to the widespread adoption of FMEA in aerospace engineering.

### 1970s: Early Industrial Adoption

The 1970s marked the expansion of FMEA beyond military and aerospace applications. The civil aviation industry and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) were among the first to integrate FMEA into their standard practices. The focus was on improving the safety and reliability of both aircraft and automobiles. During this decade, prominent organizations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the food industry, and the Ford Motor Company also began implementing FMEA to enhance their processes and products.

### 1990s: Standardization and Wider Use

In the 1990s, the automotive industry took significant steps toward standardizing FMEA practices. The Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) published the first FMEA standard specifically for the automotive industry, providing a structured methodology for identifying and addressing potential failure modes in automotive components and systems. Additionally, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) released related standards in 1994, further solidifying the use of FMEA in the industry.

### 2000s and Beyond: Global and Cross-Industry Application

Although FMEA was initially developed for military applications, its methodology is now extensively employed across a wide range of industries. Sectors such as semiconductor processing, food service, plastics manufacturing, software development, healthcare, business process outsourcing (BPO), and information technology have all adopted FMEA as a critical tool for ensuring quality and reliability.

## Conclusion

FMEA has evolved from its military origins into a universally recognized tool across numerous industries. Its systematic approach to identifying potential failure modes and mitigating risks has made it indispensable in fields where reliability and safety are paramount. As industries continue to innovate and systems become increasingly complex, the role of FMEA in ensuring the robustness and safety of products and processes will only grow in importance. The rigorous application of FMEA principles is essential for professionals in reliability engineering and related fields, ensuring that potential failures are identified early and effectively managed to prevent costly and dangerous outcomes.
