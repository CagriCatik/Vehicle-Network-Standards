# The Six Stages of FMEA

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis  is a systematic process used to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with potential failures in systems, products, or processes. This structured methodology is divided into six distinct stages that work together to provide a comprehensive risk management strategy. Below is an in-depth exploration of each stage, outlining objectives, processes, and expected outcomes.

## Overview of the FMEA Process

The FMEA process is typically divided into the following six stages:

1. **Identifying Failure Modes and Specifying Severity**
2. **Specifying the Occurrence of Failures**
3. **Specifying the Detectability of Failures**
4. **Quantifying Risk**
5. **Correcting High-Risk Situations**
6. **Reevaluating Risk**

Each stage is essential for ensuring that potential failures are not only identified but also prioritized and addressed appropriately, ultimately reducing risk and enhancing overall reliability and safety.

## Stage 1: Identifying Failure Modes and Specifying Severity

### Objective

The primary goal of Stage 1 is to systematically identify potential failure modes within the process, product, or system and to assess the severity of their effects on overall performance and safety.

### Process

1. **Step Identification:**  
   - Map out all steps and activities involved in the process, product, or system.  
   - Utilize flowcharts or process maps to ensure a comprehensive understanding, so no potential failure mode is overlooked.

2. **Brainstorming Potential Failure Modes:**  
   - For each identified step, conduct brainstorming sessions with cross-functional teams to generate a list of potential failure modes.  
   - A failure mode is any way in which a process, product, or system could fail to meet its intended function.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Mechanical failure: a component might break.  
     - Software failure: an algorithm may produce incorrect results.  
     - Procedural failure: a critical process step might be skipped.

3. **Documenting Potential Effects:**  
   - For every failure mode, document its potential effects on the process and the overall system performance.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - A mechanical failure could lead to complete system shutdown.  
     - A software failure might result in incorrect data processing.  
     - A procedural failure could cause delays in product delivery.

4. **Assigning Severity Rankings:**  
   - Based on the documented effects, assign a severity ranking to each failure mode.  
   - Severity ratings typically range from 1 (least severe) to 10 (most severe), considering impacts on customer safety, regulatory compliance, and system integrity.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - A failure mode that could lead to a life-threatening situation might receive a severity rating of 10.  
     - A minor inconvenience might be rated as 2.

### Outcome

At the end of Stage 1, you will have a detailed list of potential failure modes, their documented effects, and assigned severity rankings. This foundational information is critical for guiding the subsequent stages of the FMEA process.

## Stage 2: Specifying the Occurrence of Failures

### Objective

This stage focuses on determining the frequency or likelihood with which each identified failure mode might occur.

### Process

1. **Identifying Potential Causes:**  
   - Investigate and document the underlying causes for each failure mode identified in Stage 1.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Material fatigue might cause a mechanical failure.  
     - A coding error could be the cause of a software failure.  
     - Insufficient training may lead to procedural failures.

2. **Assigning Occurrence Ratings:**  
   - Assign a rating that reflects the likelihood of occurrence, typically on a scale from 1 (rare occurrence) to 10 (frequent occurrence).  
   - **Examples:**  
     - A failure mode with a history of frequent occurrences might be rated a 9 or 10.  
     - A failure mode that only occurs under rare conditions might be rated a 1 or 2.

### Outcome

After Stage 2, every failure mode will have an occurrence rating, providing a quantitative measure of the likelihood that each failure will occur. This metric is essential for prioritizing risks in later stages.

## Stage 3: Specifying the Detectability of Failures

### Objective

Stage 3 aims to evaluate how easily each failure mode can be detected before it results in an adverse effect.

### Process

1. **Identifying Current Process Controls:**  
   - Review existing controls that are in place to detect or prevent each failure mode.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Visual inspections, automated testing systems, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are common controls.

2. **Assigning Detection Ratings:**  
   - Based on the effectiveness of these controls, assign a detection rating for each failure mode.  
   - Ratings typically range from 1 (highly effective detection) to 10 (very poor detection capability).  
   - **Examples:**  
     - A failure mode with robust automated detection might be rated as 1 or 2.  
     - A failure mode only detectable after occurrence might be rated as 9 or 10.

### Outcome

At the conclusion of Stage 3, you will have a detection rating for each failure mode, indicating the likelihood that the failure will be caught before causing harm. This rating is a critical component of the risk assessment.

## Stage 4: Quantifying Risk

### Objective

The goal of Stage 4 is to quantify the overall risk associated with each failure mode by combining the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings into a single metric known as the Risk Priority Number (RPN).

### Process

1. **Calculating the Risk Priority Number (RPN):**  
   - Use the formula:  
   - RPN = Severity x Occurrence x Detection
    
   - **Example:**  
     - If a failure mode has a severity rating of 8, an occurrence rating of 6, and a detection rating of 5, the RPN would be:
     - 8 x 6 x 5 = 240


2. **Ranking the Failure Modes:**  
   - Rank all failure modes by their RPN values from highest to lowest.  
   - Higher RPNs indicate higher risks, which should be prioritized for corrective action.

### Outcome

Stage 4 produces a ranked list of failure modes based on their RPNs, clearly highlighting the areas of greatest risk that require immediate attention.

---

## Stage 5: Correcting High-Risk Situations

### Objective

This stage focuses on developing and implementing corrective actions for failure modes with the highest RPNs.

### Process

1. **Documenting Recommended Actions:**  
   - For each high-risk failure mode, document specific corrective actions designed to reduce risk.  
   - **Examples:**  
     - Upgrading materials to prevent mechanical failure.  
     - Revising software code to eliminate errors.  
     - Enhancing training programs to prevent procedural errors.

2. **Assigning Responsibility and Target Dates:**  
   - Assign responsibility for implementing each corrective action and establish clear target dates for their completion.  
   - **Example:**  
     - The engineering team might be tasked with developing a new material specification within three months.

### Outcome

At the end of Stage 5, you will have a detailed action plan addressing the highest-risk failure modes. This plan will include clear responsibilities and deadlines, ensuring that corrective measures are implemented efficiently and effectively.

---

## Stage 6: Reevaluating Risk

### Objective

The final stage is to reassess the risks after corrective actions have been implemented, ensuring that the desired risk reduction has been achieved.

### Process

1. **Documenting Specific Actions Taken:**  
   - Record the corrective actions implemented, including any changes to the process, product, or system.
   - **Example:**  
     - Document the introduction of a new material specification and the results from subsequent testing.

2. **Revising Severity, Occurrence, and Detection Ratings:**  
   - Reevaluate the ratings for each failure mode to reflect the impact of the corrective actions.  
   - **Example:**  
     - A failure mode previously rated with a detection score of 9 might now be rated at 3 due to improved monitoring systems.

3. **Calculating the New RPN:**  
   - Recalculate the RPN using the updated ratings and compare these new values to the original RPNs to assess the effectiveness of the interventions.

4. **Documenting and Communicating Results:**  
   - Document the final, updated RPNs and share the outcomes with all relevant stakeholders. This ensures transparency and confirms that risk mitigation efforts have been successful.

### Outcome

Stage 6 culminates in an updated risk assessment that reflects the current state of the system after corrective actions have been applied. This re-evaluation confirms that risks have been effectively reduced and that the process is now more robust.
