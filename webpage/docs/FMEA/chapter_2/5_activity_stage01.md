# Activity: Stage 01


## Question 1: What does a severity ranking of one indicate?

- A) No effect
- B) An effect of hazardous without warning
- C) An effect of hazardous with warning
- D) A very minor effect

**Answer:** A) No effect  
*Explanation:* A severity ranking of one indicates that there is no effect. The scale goes up to ten, where ten represents an effect that is hazardous without warning.

## Question 2: Severity applies to which of the following

- A) The potential failure mode
- B) The effect of failure
- C) Both the potential failure mode and the effect of failure
- D) Neither the potential failure mode nor the effect of failure

**Answer:** B) The effect of failure  
*Explanation:* Severity is the assessment of the seriousness of the effect of a potential failure mode. It applies only to the effect of the failure, not the potential failure mode itself.

## Question 3: The statement "Potential failure mode is equal to in what ways the step can go right" is

- A) True
- B) False

**Answer:** B) False  
*Explanation:* Potential failure mode refers to "in what ways can the step go wrong," not how it can go right.
