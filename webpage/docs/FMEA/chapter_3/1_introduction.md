# Stage 02: Specifying the Occurrence of Failure

In the process of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Stage 02 is dedicated to specifying the occurrence of failure. This stage builds upon the foundational understanding developed in Stage 01, where the identification of failure modes and the specification of their severity were discussed. Stage 02 is crucial, as it determines how often a particular failure mode is likely to occur, which directly impacts the prioritization of actions to mitigate risks.

## Overview of Stage 02

The primary objective of Stage 02 is to assess the likelihood of each identified failure mode occurring. This involves a thorough examination of potential causes, the determination of an occurrence rating, and the application of statistical and experiential data to support the analysis. Accurate specification of occurrence is essential, as it influences the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which guides the focus of subsequent risk mitigation efforts.

## 1. Identifying Potential Causes

Understanding the potential causes of failure is a critical step in this stage. A failure mode typically has one or more root causes that contribute to its occurrence. These causes can stem from a variety of sources, including:

- **Design flaws**: Inadequate or incorrect design decisions that introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Manufacturing defects**: Issues arising during the production process, such as improper assembly or material defects.
- **Human error**: Mistakes made during operation, maintenance, or assembly.
- **Environmental factors**: External conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or exposure to chemicals, that can degrade system performance.
- **Wear and tear**: Gradual degradation due to prolonged use or age of components.

A comprehensive identification of potential causes requires a multidisciplinary approach, often involving experts from design, manufacturing, quality assurance, and field operations. It is critical to ensure that all possible causes are considered to prevent the oversight of less obvious, yet potentially significant, factors.

## 2. Determining the Occurrence Rating

Once potential causes are identified, the next step is to determine the occurrence rating for each failure mode. The occurrence rating is a numerical value that represents the probability of a failure mode occurring within a specific timeframe or under specific operating conditions. The rating is typically based on a predefined scale, often ranging from 1 (extremely unlikely) to 10 (almost certain).

The determination of this rating can be informed by several factors:

- **Historical data**: Previous incidents and failure data provide empirical evidence for the likelihood of recurrence.
- **Statistical analysis**: Reliability engineering techniques, such as Weibull analysis, can be used to model the probability of failure.
- **Expert judgment**: In the absence of sufficient data, experienced engineers may provide an informed estimate of occurrence based on their knowledge and experience.
- **Simulation and testing**: Controlled experiments and simulations can help predict failure probabilities under various conditions.

The occurrence rating must be carefully calibrated to reflect the true likelihood of failure. Overestimating the occurrence can lead to unnecessary resource allocation, while underestimating it can result in insufficient mitigation measures.

## 3. Practical Application: Evaluating Occurrence in a Case Study

To illustrate the application of these concepts, consider a hypothetical case study involving a consumer electronics product, such as a smartphone. Suppose one of the identified failure modes is a malfunction of the touch screen interface.

### Step 1: Identifying Potential Causes

- **Design flaw**: A poorly calibrated touch sensor could result in inaccurate inputs.
- **Manufacturing defect**: Inconsistent application of adhesive during assembly could cause the touch screen to detach slightly from the display.
- **Environmental factors**: Exposure to high humidity could lead to moisture ingress, affecting the screen's responsiveness.

### Step 2: Determining the Occurrence Rating

- **Historical data**: Analysis of warranty claims indicates that 2% of units experience touch screen issues within the first year.
- **Statistical analysis**: Using Weibull analysis, it is estimated that the likelihood of failure increases by 0.5% each year, reaching a 4% probability by the third year.
- **Expert judgment**: Engineers estimate a 3/10 rating for occurrence based on similar past products.
- **Simulation and testing**: Environmental testing under high humidity conditions shows a 5% failure rate.

Based on the combined analysis, the occurrence rating might be set at 4/10, indicating a moderate probability of failure.

## Conclusion

Stage 02 of the FMEA process—specifying the occurrence of failure—is integral to building an accurate risk profile for each failure mode. By systematically identifying potential causes and determining a precise occurrence rating, reliability engineers can prioritize failure modes effectively, ensuring that the most critical risks are addressed in subsequent stages of the analysis. This stage requires rigorous analysis, combining empirical data with expert judgment, to ensure that the FMEA process remains scientifically robust and effective in enhancing the reliability of systems and products.
