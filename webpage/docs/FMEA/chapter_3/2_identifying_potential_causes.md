# Identifying Potential Causes in Failure Modes and Effects Analysis

In FMEA, identifying the potential causes of each failure mode is a critical step that lays the foundation for assessing failure likelihood and developing effective mitigation strategies. This process centers on answering the question: *What could lead to the failure mode occurring?* By focusing on specific, actionable factors, the analysis becomes both comprehensive and precise.

## Key Considerations in Identifying Potential Causes

### 1. Specificity

- **Precision in Description:**  
  Each potential cause must be described in clear, specific terms. Avoid vague or generic descriptors like "mechanical failure" or "system error." For example, rather than noting a generic failure, specify issues such as "wear of the ball bearings in the motor assembly" or "memory leak in the software application."  
  This precision helps isolate the root problem and facilitates targeted corrective actions.

### 2. Correctability and Control

- **Actionable Factors:**  
  The focus should be on causes that are amenable to correction or control. Whether through design modifications, process improvements, or maintenance procedures, identifying causes that can be mitigated ensures that the FMEA is a practical tool for risk management.

### 3. Expert Input

- **Collaboration with SMEs:**  
  Subject matter experts (SMEs) provide invaluable insights during brainstorming sessions. Their technical knowledge helps validate potential causes and ensures that the analysis reflects the actual operational and technical nuances of the system.  
  The facilitator’s role is to guide the discussion and document the expertise shared by these experts.

### 4. Comprehensive Listing

- **Inclusivity in Documentation:**  
  Even seemingly minor potential causes should be captured. Each factor might contribute to failure under specific conditions, and a thorough documentation ensures that no risk is overlooked. This comprehensive approach creates a detailed map of risk factors that supports subsequent analysis and corrective planning.

## Example Analysis: Call Handling in a Telecommunication System

To illustrate the process, consider a telecommunication system with several identified failure modes. The following examples highlight how potential causes are pinpointed with clarity and specificity.

### Failure Mode: No Incoming Calls

- **Potential Causes:**
  - CMS (Call Management System) link failure.
  - Peripheral gateway server malfunction affecting incoming calls.
  - Configuration errors in the routing of inbound calls through the peripheral gateway.

In this example, the causes are focused on distinct technical issues. The clarity in identifying these factors enables targeted troubleshooting and preventive measures.

### Failure Mode: Call Drops

- **Potential Causes:**
  - Fluctuations in trunk lines at the local end or from the service provider.
  - Network instability or interruptions in connectivity.

Here, the potential causes address the stability and reliability of the communication network, which might be influenced by external service provider issues or local infrastructure challenges.

### Failure Mode: Static or Bad Connection

- **Potential Causes:**
  - Faulty headset or damaged connecting cord.
  - Issues in trunk lines either locally or from the service provider.
  - Malfunction at the caller's end or within the phone system.

This example spans a range of causes—from hardware issues to external network errors—each clearly defined and actionable. Such detailed identification facilitates effective corrective measures.

### Failure Mode: Low Voice Quality (Lower Decibel Level)

- **Potential Cause:**
  - Improper routing configuration at the peripheral gateway.

A specific configuration issue is pinpointed as the root cause, emphasizing the necessity of precision in the identification process. Correcting the configuration can directly address the quality issue.

## Documenting Potential Causes

For effective use in FMEA, documentation must be clear and well-structured. Each potential cause should be listed concisely and in a format that supports easy reference during subsequent analysis steps, such as determining occurrence ratings and implementing corrective actions. The documentation should capture:
- A comprehensive list of causes,
- Detailed descriptions that facilitate troubleshooting,
- Inputs from SME discussions,
- And a focus on correctable or controllable factors.

This structured documentation becomes the backbone of the FMEA process, ensuring that every plausible risk factor is addressed.

## Conclusion

Identifying potential causes in FMEA is not merely an exercise in listing possible issues; it is about creating a detailed, actionable map of risk factors. By emphasizing specificity, focusing on correctability, leveraging expert input, and ensuring comprehensive coverage, this stage of FMEA provides a robust basis for evaluating occurrence ratings and prioritizing risk mitigation efforts. This methodological rigor enhances system reliability and supports effective risk management across diverse applications.
