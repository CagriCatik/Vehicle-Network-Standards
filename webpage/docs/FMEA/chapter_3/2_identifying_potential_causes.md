# Identifying Potential Causes in Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

## Understanding Potential Causes

In the process of conducting a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), identifying the potential causes of each failure mode is a crucial step. This step requires a focused and methodical approach, as it lays the foundation for assessing the likelihood of failure and developing effective mitigation strategies.

When considering potential causes, it is essential to ask the question: *What could lead to the failure mode occurring?* This inquiry directs attention to specific factors that can be controlled, corrected, or monitored. The goal is to identify every plausible cause that might lead to a particular failure mode, ensuring that the analysis is as comprehensive and precise as possible.

### Key Considerations in Identifying Potential Causes

1. **Specificity**: Each potential cause should be listed with as much specificity as possible. Vague or ambiguous descriptions, such as "mechanical failure" or "system error," should be avoided. Instead, pinpoint the exact issue, such as "wear of the ball bearings in the motor assembly" or "memory leak in the software application."

2. **Correctability and Control**: Focus on causes that can be corrected or controlled through design changes, process improvements, or maintenance procedures. This focus ensures that the FMEA serves as a practical tool for risk management.

3. **Expert Input**: Engage subject matter experts (SMEs) to brainstorm and validate potential causes. While a deep technical understanding is beneficial, the facilitator's role is primarily to guide the discussion and capture the expertise shared by the SMEs.

4. **Comprehensive Listing**: Ensure that all relevant causes are documented. Even seemingly minor causes should be included, as they may contribute to failure under specific conditions.

### Example Analysis: Call Handling in a Telecommunication System

To illustrate the identification of potential causes, consider the example of a telecommunication system with several identified failure modes.

#### Failure Mode: No Incoming Calls

- **Potential Causes**:
  - CMS (Call Management System) link failure.
  - Peripheral gateway server malfunction affecting incoming calls.
  - Configuration errors in the routing of inbound calls through the peripheral gateway.

In this case, the potential causes focus on specific technical issues that can be isolated and addressed, such as a server malfunction or configuration error. These causes were identified through a brainstorming session with SMEs who understand the intricacies of the telecommunication system.

#### Failure Mode: Call Drops

- **Potential Causes**:
  - Fluctuations in trunk lines at the local end or from the service provider.
  - Network instability or interruptions in connectivity.

Here, the causes are related to the stability and reliability of the communication network, which can be affected by external factors like service provider issues or local infrastructure problems.

#### Failure Mode: Static or Bad Connection

- **Potential Causes**:
  - Faulty headset or damaged connecting cord.
  - Issues in trunk lines either locally or from the service provider.
  - Malfunction at the caller's end or within the phone system.

This example highlights a range of potential causes, from hardware issues (like a faulty headset) to external factors (such as network errors). Each cause is specific and actionable, providing clear guidance for troubleshooting and mitigation.

#### Failure Mode: Low Voice Quality (Lower Decibel Level)

- **Potential Cause**:
  - Improper routing configuration at the peripheral gateway.

This cause points to a configuration issue that could be corrected through system adjustments, emphasizing the importance of precision in identifying root causes.

## Documenting Potential Causes

When documenting potential causes in an FMEA, it is vital to ensure that the causes are listed clearly and concisely. The documentation should be structured in a way that allows for easy reference and analysis, facilitating the subsequent steps in the FMEA process, such as determining occurrence ratings and implementing corrective actions.

## Conclusion

The identification of potential causes is a fundamental aspect of the FMEA process, requiring careful consideration and collaboration with experts. By focusing on specific, controllable factors, the analysis can effectively guide efforts to improve system reliability and prevent failures. This stage is not just about listing possible issues but about creating a detailed map of risk factors that can be systematically addressed to enhance overall system performance.
