# Understanding the Occurrence Rating in FMEA

The occurrence rating in Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a critical metric used to assess the likelihood that a specific failure mode will occur due to a particular cause. This rating is essential for prioritizing risks and determining where to focus mitigation efforts. The occurrence rating is typically expressed on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing the least likely occurrence and 10 representing the highest likelihood.

## Defining the Occurrence Rating

- **Occurrence**: This refers to the frequency or probability that a specific failure will happen due to a defined cause within a given timeframe or number of operations.
- **Scale**: The rating scale for occurrence typically ranges from 1 to 10:
  - **1**: Extremely unlikely, with a probability of occurrence being 1 in 1,000,000 instances.
  - **2**: Very low likelihood, with an occurrence probability of 1 in 20,000 instances.
  - **4**: Low likelihood, with a failure occurring once every 2,000 instances.
  - **7**: Moderate likelihood, with a failure occurring once every 50 instances.
  - **9**: High likelihood, with a failure occurring once every 10 instances.
  - **10**: Very high likelihood, with a failure expected in 1 out of 2 instances.

The occurrence rating must be assigned based on empirical data, historical records, or expert judgment. It is imperative that the rating is accurate, as an incorrect rating could either lead to the underestimation or overestimation of the risk associated with a failure mode.

## Conditions for Adjusting the Occurrence Rating

A key principle in FMEA is that any reduction in the occurrence rating should not be based on speculative reasoning or assumptions. It must be rooted in tangible changes to the business process, design, or operational procedures. For example:

- **Process Improvement**: Implementing a new quality control step that significantly reduces the likelihood of a defect.
- **Design Modification**: Altering a component design to eliminate a common failure point.
- **Operational Changes**: Updating procedures to address human errors that contribute to the failure.

Only these direct and verifiable changes can justify a decrease in the occurrence rating, ensuring that the FMEA remains an objective tool for risk management.

## Example Application: Call Center Case Study

To illustrate how occurrence ratings are applied, let’s revisit the call center example where various failure modes have been identified:

- **Failure Mode: No Calls**
  - **Occurrence Rating**: 7
  - **Explanation**: This failure occurs once in every 50 calls, indicating a moderate probability that could significantly impact operations if not addressed.

- **Failure Mode: Call Drops**
  - **Occurrence Rating**: 2
  - **Explanation**: This failure is rare, occurring once in every 20,000 calls, signifying that it is not a major concern under current conditions.

- **Failure Mode: Bad Connection or Static**
  - **Occurrence Rating**: 4
  - **Explanation**: Occurring once in every 2,000 calls, this issue has a low but notable frequency, requiring monitoring and potential corrective actions.

- **Failure Mode: Lower Decibel in Voice Quality**
  - **Occurrence Rating**: 4
  - **Explanation**: This issue also occurs once in every 2,000 calls, indicating a similar level of concern as bad connections or static.

## Practical Activity

As part of your FMEA, it is essential to assign occurrence ratings to each identified failure mode based on the specific context of your industry, whether it be manufacturing or services. To assist in this task, review the occurrence rating scales provided for both industries, and apply the most appropriate rating based on your analysis.

## Conclusion

The occurrence rating is a pivotal part of the FMEA process, guiding teams to focus on the most likely failure modes. By accurately determining this rating, organizations can prioritize their risk mitigation strategies effectively, ensuring that resources are allocated to the areas of highest need. Remember, adjustments to occurrence ratings should only be made based on verifiable changes to processes, design, or operations, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the FMEA.
