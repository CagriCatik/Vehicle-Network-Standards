## Question 1

An occurrence ranking of ten indicates which of the following?

a) Occurrence is very high. Failure is almost inevitable (1 in 2 instances).  
b) Occurrence is remote. Failure is unlikely (1 in 1.5 million instances).  
c) Occurrence is high. Repeated failures (1 in every 20 instances).  
d) Occurrence is moderate. Occasional failures (1 in 400 instances).

**Correct Answer:**  
**a) Occurrence is very high. Failure is almost inevitable (1 in 2 instances).**

**Explanation:**  
An occurrence ranking of ten signifies a very high probability of failure, indicating that failure is almost inevitable, occurring in 1 out of every 2 instances. This high ranking highlights a critical area of concern that requires immediate attention in the FMEA process.

## Question 2

Occurrence is defined as how frequently a specific failure is projected to occur. It is the chance that one of the specific causes will lead to failure.

Is this statement true or false?

**Correct Answer:**  
**True**

**Explanation:**  
The statement is true. Occurrence in FMEA refers to the probability or frequency with which a specific failure is expected to occur due to a particular cause. Understanding this helps in prioritizing risks based on their likelihood and ensures that the most significant potential failures are addressed effectively.
