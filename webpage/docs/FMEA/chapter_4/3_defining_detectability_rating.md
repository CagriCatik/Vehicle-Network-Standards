# Defining the Detectability Rating

Detectability in the FMEA process is a critical factor that assesses the likelihood that a current process control will identify a potential weakness or failure mode before it can affect the product or service delivered to the customer. This assessment is performed under the assumption that the failure has already occurred, allowing the team to focus on evaluating the effectiveness of the detection mechanisms in place.

When defining the Detectability rating, it is essential to remember that this rating should not be influenced by the frequency of occurrences but should solely reflect the ability of the process controls to detect the failure once it has happened. Low-frequency failure modes, although rare, must still be rigorously assessed to ensure that the detection controls can identify them and prevent them from progressing further in the process.

## Key Considerations for Assigning a Detectability Rating

- **Assessment of Process Capabilities**: Evaluate the current process controls to determine their effectiveness in detecting specific failure modes. This involves a thorough analysis of the control mechanisms, considering their sensitivity, reliability, and the speed at which they can identify a failure.

- **Consistency in Evaluation**: The criteria and ranking system for Detectability should be agreed upon by the entire FMEA team and applied consistently throughout the process. This ensures that all failure modes are assessed under the same standards, leading to a fair and accurate representation of risk.

- **Avoiding Assumptions Based on Occurrence**: Detectability ratings should not be automatically lowered because a failure mode has a low occurrence. Instead, the team should critically assess whether the detection controls are capable of identifying even these low-frequency failures.

## Detectability Rating Scale

The Detectability rating is typically represented on a scale from 1 to 10, where:

- **1**: Indicates that the process control will detect the failure mode every time it occurs, essentially a 100% detection probability.
- **2**: Represents a 99% probability of detection.
- **...**
- **9**: Corresponds to a 50% probability of detecting the failure mode.
- **10**: Indicates a less than 50% probability that the failure mode will be detected.

Each rating level between these extremes corresponds to a slightly lower or higher probability of detection. This scale allows the team to quantify the effectiveness of their detection controls and compare them across different failure modes.

## Example: Applying Detectability Ratings

Consider the following examples to illustrate how Detectability ratings might be assigned based on the current process controls:

- **Failure Mode: No Calls**
  - **Detectability Rating**: 3
  - **Explanation**: The process control in place (e.g., continuous monitoring of the CMS) detects this failure mode 95% of the time, indicating a relatively high likelihood of detection.

- **Failure Mode: Call Drops**
  - **Detectability Rating**: 1
  - **Explanation**: The monitoring systems for trunks and alarms on the PBX are so effective that they detect call drops 100% of the time. This warrants the highest Detectability rating, reflecting complete reliability in detecting this failure mode.

- **Failure Mode: Bad Connection or Static**
  - **Detectability Rating**: 1
  - **Explanation**: The combination of hardware checks (e.g., replacing headsets) and systems monitoring ensures that this failure mode is detected every time it occurs, justifying a Detectability rating of 1.

- **Failure Mode: Lower Decibel in Voice Quality**
  - **Detectability Rating**: 1
  - **Explanation**: The escalation procedures in place ensure that issues with voice quality are always identified and addressed, leading to a Detectability rating of 1.

## Activity: Assigning Detectability Ratings

As part of your ongoing FMEA activity, you should now identify and assign a Detectability rating for each failure mode you have documented. This step involves carefully considering the current process controls and evaluating their ability to detect failures effectively.

To assist you further, I have provided Detectability rating guidelines specific to both manufacturing and service industries. These resources are available for download in the Resources section of this lecture. Reviewing these guidelines will give you a clearer understanding of the rating scales and help you apply them accurately in your FMEA analysis.

By methodically applying these ratings, you will enhance the rigor and reliability of your FMEA, ensuring that all potential risks are thoroughly assessed and managed.
