# Defining the Detectability Rating

Detectability in FMEA is a critical factor that measures the likelihood that a process control will identify a failure mode after it has occurredâ€”but before it adversely affects the product or service. Importantly, the Detectability rating focuses solely on the effectiveness of detection controls and is independent of the failure mode's occurrence frequency. Even low-frequency failures must be rigorously evaluated to ensure that detection mechanisms are robust.

## Key Considerations for Assigning a Detectability Rating

When determining the Detectability rating, consider the following factors:

- **Assessment of Process Capabilities:**  
  Evaluate how effective current process controls are at detecting specific failure modes. This includes analyzing:
  - Sensitivity of the detection mechanisms.
  - Reliability and consistency.
  - Response time for identifying failures.

- **Consistency in Evaluation:**  
  The criteria and ranking system for Detectability should be agreed upon by the entire FMEA team. A consistent approach ensures that every failure mode is assessed under the same standards, resulting in a fair and accurate representation of risk.

- **Avoiding Occurrence-Based Assumptions:**  
  The Detectability rating must not be influenced by how often a failure occurs. Even if a failure mode is rare, the detection controls must be evaluated rigorously to confirm their ability to identify the failure when it happens.

## Detectability Rating Scale

The Detectability rating is typically represented on a scale from 1 to 10, where each number corresponds to the probability of detecting the failure mode:

- **1:** The process control detects the failure mode every time it occurs (100% detection probability).
- **2:** Indicates a 99% probability of detection.
- **...**
- **9:** Corresponds to about a 50% probability of detecting the failure mode.
- **10:** Less than a 50% probability of detection.

Each level on the scale reflects a slight variation in detection probability, allowing teams to quantify and compare the effectiveness of detection controls across various failure modes.

## Example: Applying Detectability Ratings

Consider the following examples, which illustrate how Detectability ratings may be assigned based on the current process controls:

- **Failure Mode: No Calls**  
  - **Detectability Rating:** 3  
  - **Explanation:** The continuous monitoring of the Call Management System (CMS) detects this failure mode approximately 95% of the time, reflecting a high likelihood of detection.

- **Failure Mode: Call Drops**  
  - **Detectability Rating:** 1  
  - **Explanation:** The monitoring systems for trunks and alarms on the Private Branch Exchange (PBX) are extremely effective, detecting call drops 100% of the time, hence a rating of 1.

- **Failure Mode: Bad Connection or Static**  
  - **Detectability Rating:** 1  
  - **Explanation:** A combination of hardware checks (such as replacing headsets) and robust systems monitoring ensures that this failure mode is always detected, justifying a rating of 1.

- **Failure Mode: Lower Decibel in Voice Quality**  
  - **Detectability Rating:** 1  
  - **Explanation:** Effective escalation procedures guarantee that issues with voice quality are promptly identified and addressed, leading to a rating of 1.

## Activity: Assigning Detectability Ratings

As part of your FMEA analysis, you should now:
- Review each documented failure mode.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of current process controls in detecting these failures.
- Assign a Detectability rating based on the guidelines provided above.

For further assistance, refer to the Detectability rating guidelines available in the Resources section, which include specific recommendations for both manufacturing and service industries. Applying these ratings methodically will enhance the rigor and reliability of your FMEA, ensuring that all potential risks are comprehensively assessed and managed.
