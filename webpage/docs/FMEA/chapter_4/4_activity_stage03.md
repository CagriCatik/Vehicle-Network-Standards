**1. Current process controls are descriptions of the controls that either prevent the failure mode from occurring or detect the failure mode if it should occur.**

- A) True
- B) False

*Correct Answer:* **A) True**

---

**2. A detectability ranking of 10 indicates that the likelihood of detection is:**

- A) Remote
- B) Absolutely impossible
- C) Almost certain
- D) None of the above

*Correct Answer:* **B) Absolutely impossible**

---

**3. A detectability ranking of 1 indicates that the likelihood of detection is:**

- A) Remote
- B) Absolutely impossible
- C) Almost certain
- D) Unlikely

*Correct Answer:* **C) Almost certain**

**4. When assigning a detectability rating, you should:**

- A) Assume a low detection ranking if occurrences are low.
- B) Evaluate the ability of process controls to detect low-frequency failure modes.
- C) Automatically assign a low detection ranking if the failure mode is rare.
- D) Use the same detectability rating for all failure modes.

*Correct Answer:* **B) Evaluate the ability of process controls to detect low-frequency failure modes.**

---

**5. The detectability rating is used to:**

- A) Determine how likely it is that a failure mode will occur.
- B) Assess the likelihood that a failure mode will be detected once it has occurred.
- C) Measure the severity of a failure mode.
- D) Prevent a failure mode from happening.

*Correct Answer:* **B) Assess the likelihood that a failure mode will be detected once it has occurred.**

**6. Which of the following is *not* a factor to consider when assigning a detectability rating?**

- A) Sensitivity of the detection method
- B) Frequency of monitoring
- C) Reliability of the detection system
- D) Cost of the detection method

*Correct Answer:* **D) Cost of the detection method**

---

**7. In the context of FMEA, why is it important to not automatically assume a low detectability rating for low-occurrence failure modes?**

- A) Low-occurrence failure modes are not important.
- B) Even rare failure modes can have significant impacts if not detected.
- C) Low-occurrence failure modes are always detected easily.
- D) The detectability rating should always match the occurrence rating.

*Correct Answer:* **B) Even rare failure modes can have significant impacts if not detected.**
