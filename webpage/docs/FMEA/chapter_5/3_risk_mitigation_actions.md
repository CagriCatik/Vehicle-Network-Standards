# Recommended Actions for Risk Mitigation

After calculating the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each failure mode in the FMEA process, the next critical step is to determine and implement corrective actions that mitigate these risks. Recommended actions focus on reducing one or more components of the RPNâ€”namely severity, occurrence, or detectability. By targeting high RPN values and failure modes with high severity ratings, even if their overall RPN is moderate, teams can ensure that the most critical risks are addressed effectively.

## What Are Recommended Actions?

Recommended actions are specific steps that your team can take to reduce the risk associated with each failure mode. These actions can include design improvements, process modifications, enhanced testing, or new monitoring strategies, and they aim to:

- **Reduce Occurrence:** Lower the probability that a failure mode will happen.
- **Improve Detectability:** Increase the likelihood that a failure mode is identified before it causes harm.
- **Mitigate Severity:** Decrease the impact or consequences if the failure mode does occur.

By lowering the ratings for severity, occurrence, or detectability, the overall RPN decreases, thereby reducing the risk to an acceptable level.

## How Recommended Actions Influence RPN Components

Each recommended action is designed to target a specific component of the RPN:

### 1. Reducing Occurrence
- **Objective:** Lower the frequency or likelihood that the failure mode will occur.
- **Possible Actions:**  
  - Redesign processes or components to eliminate root causes.
  - Enhance preventive maintenance practices.
  - Improve process controls to reduce variability.
- **Impact:** A successful action here will result in a lower occurrence rating, directly reducing the RPN.

### 2. Improving Detectability
- **Objective:** Enhance the capability of detection controls so that the failure is caught before it reaches the customer or causes significant harm.
- **Possible Actions:**  
  - Implement more stringent inspection protocols.
  - Introduce advanced monitoring systems or testing procedures.
  - Enhance process validation methods.
- **Impact:** By lowering the detectability rating (i.e., making failure detection more reliable), the overall RPN is reduced.

### 3. Mitigating Severity
- **Objective:** Decrease the potential impact of the failure mode if it does occur.
- **Possible Actions:**  
  - Make design changes to reduce the potential harm.
  - Incorporate fail-safe features.
  - Revise operating procedures to minimize damage in the event of a failure.
- **Impact:** Although reducing severity can be challenging, effective measures here have a profound impact on the RPN and are particularly critical for high-impact failure modes.

In some instances, no further actions may be available to reduce the RPN. In such cases, it is important to document that no feasible actions exist, ensuring future users of the FMEA understand that the failure mode has been thoroughly reviewed.

## Practical Example: Recommended Actions

Consider the following examples based on previous failure modes:

### Failure Mode: No Calls
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Implement a voice disaster recovery infrastructure.
  - Develop and deploy a notification procedure or escalation matrix.
  - Conduct awareness training on the escalation matrix for frontline supervisors.
- **Impact:**  
  These actions are intended to reduce both the occurrence (by ensuring system redundancy) and the detectability (by improving response protocols).

### Failure Mode: Call Drops
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Conduct a timely review and update of the escalation matrix.
  - Increase staff awareness and training to ensure adherence to the escalation procedures.
- **Impact:**  
  Focuses on improving detectability by ensuring that issues are recognized and addressed promptly.

### Failure Mode: Bad Connection
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Replace faulty headsets immediately under supervisor oversight.
  - Deploy network boosters by the voice and telecom teams to improve connectivity.
- **Impact:**  
  Aims to reduce both occurrence (through better equipment) and detectability (by ensuring issues are detected early).

### Failure Mode: Lower Decibel in Voice Quality
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Collaborate with vendors to identify and correct the root cause of poor voice quality.
  - Implement regular asset maintenance to prevent equipment deterioration.
- **Impact:**  
  These measures reduce the occurrence of the failure mode by ensuring proactive maintenance and addressing underlying issues.

## Implementing and Documenting Recommended Actions

For each identified failure mode in your FMEA, ensure that recommended actions are thoroughly documented. Each action should include:

- **Description:**  
  Clearly outline what needs to be done.
- **Responsible Party:**  
  Assign accountability to a specific individual or team.
- **Target Completion Date:**  
  Establish a timeline for the implementation of the action.
- **Expected Outcome:**  
  Detail the anticipated effect on the RPN, specifying which component(s) (Severity, Occurrence, Detectability) will be lowered.

Consistent monitoring of the implementation process is essential. Once corrective actions are in place, reassess the RPN to confirm that the risk has been effectively mitigated and that the system's reliability has improved.

## Activity: Developing Recommended Actions for Your FMEA

Now it is your turn to apply these principles:
1. Review the failure modes identified in your FMEA and calculate their RPNs.
2. Develop and document recommended actions for each failure mode, prioritizing those with high RPNs and/or high severity.
3. Assign responsibilities, set target dates, and specify expected outcomes.
4. Monitor the implementation and re-evaluate the RPN to ensure that corrective actions have reduced the risk to acceptable levels.

By systematically addressing each failure mode with targeted actions, you can significantly reduce risks and enhance the overall reliability and safety of your systems.
