# Assigning Responsibility, Target Completion Dates, and Actions Taken

In the FMEA process, assigning responsibility, establishing target completion dates, and documenting actions taken are critical steps. These elements ensure that recommended actions are implemented effectively, that progress is tracked, and that future users of the FMEA can understand the history and outcomes of risk mitigation efforts.

## Assigning Responsibility and Setting Target Completion Dates

### Clear Assignment of Responsibility
- **Definition:**  
  Assigning responsibility involves designating a specific individual or team accountable for implementing each recommended action.
- **Key Points:**  
  - **Clarity:** Clearly define the names or roles of those responsible to avoid any ambiguity.  
  - **Authority and Resources:** Ensure the assigned party has the necessary authority and resources to execute the action effectively.
  
### Establishing Target Completion Dates
- **Definition:**  
  A target completion date is the set deadline by which the recommended action should be fully implemented.
- **Key Points:**  
  - **Timeliness:** Setting a deadline maintains momentum and ensures that risk mitigation efforts are carried out without undue delay.  
  - **Tracking:** These dates serve as benchmarks for monitoring progress and for future reassessment of the FMEA.

Documenting both responsibility and target dates creates a historical record that helps future users understand who was accountable for each action and when it was expected to be completed.

## Documenting Actions Taken

Once a recommended action is implemented, it is crucial to document the actual actions taken. This documentation should include:

- **Description of the Action Taken:**  
  Provide a clear and concise description of what was implemented. Note any adjustments made during the implementation process.
  
- **Effective Date:**  
  Record the date when the action was fully executed. This information helps in tracking progress and verifying the implementation timeline.
  
- **Outcome or Results (Optional):**  
  If available, include a brief summary of the outcomes or results observed after the action was implemented. This helps in assessing the effectiveness of the corrective action in reducing risk.

Proper documentation of these elements ensures transparency, supports continuous improvement, and provides a reference for future reviews of the FMEA.

## Practical Example: Assigning Responsibility, Target Dates, and Documenting Actions

Below is an example that demonstrates how to document these details for various failure modes:

1. **Failure Mode: No Calls**
   - **Recommended Action:**  
     Implement a voice disaster recovery infrastructure.
   - **Responsibility:**  
     IT Infrastructure Team
   - **Target Completion Date:**  
     October 15, 2024
   - **Action Taken:**  
     Disaster recovery infrastructure implemented as planned.  
     **Effective Date:** October 15, 2024

2. **Failure Mode: Call Drops**
   - **Recommended Action:**  
     Conduct a timely review of the escalation matrix.
   - **Responsibility:**  
     Operations Manager
   - **Target Completion Date:**  
     September 30, 2024
   - **Action Taken:**  
     Escalation matrix reviewed and updated.  
     **Effective Date:** September 30, 2024

3. **Failure Mode: Bad Connections**
   - **Recommended Action:**  
     Replace faulty headsets.
   - **Responsibility:**  
     Supervisors
   - **Target Completion Date:**  
     August 20, 2024
   - **Action Taken:**  
     All faulty headsets replaced with new ones.  
     **Effective Date:** August 20, 2024

4. **Failure Mode: Lower Decibel in Voice Quality**
   - **Recommended Action:**  
     Work with the vendor to identify and resolve the root cause.
   - **Responsibility:**  
     Telephony Team
   - **Target Completion Date:**  
     November 5, 2024
   - **Action Taken:**  
     Vendor identified and resolved the issue.  
     **Effective Date:** November 5, 2024

## Activity: Documenting Responsibility, Target Completion Dates, and Actions Taken

Now, itâ€™s time to apply this process to your own FMEA:
1. **Review Your Recommended Actions:**  
   For each failure mode in your FMEA, list the recommended actions.
2. **Assign Responsibility:**  
   Clearly document who is responsible for implementing each action (include names or roles).
3. **Set Target Completion Dates:**  
   Establish a specific deadline for when each action should be completed.
4. **Document the Implementation:**  
   After an action is implemented, record the actual action taken along with its effective date. Optionally, include a note on the outcomes observed.
5. **Maintain the Record:**  
   Keep this documentation up-to-date so that future users of the FMEA can review the history of risk mitigation efforts and assess the effectiveness of the actions taken.

By systematically documenting responsibility, target completion dates, and actions taken, you not only ensure accountability but also create a valuable resource for continuous improvement. This structured approach is essential for the long-term success of your FMEA process, providing transparency and enabling effective risk management.
