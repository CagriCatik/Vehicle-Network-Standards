# Assigning Responsibility, Target Completion Dates, and Actions Taken

In the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) process, documenting responsibility, setting target completion dates, and recording actions taken are essential steps that ensure accountability and provide a clear record of progress. These elements are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the FMEA and for enabling future users of the document to understand the history and effectiveness of the actions implemented.

## Assigning Responsibility and Setting Target Completion Dates

Once recommended actions have been identified for each failure mode, it is imperative to assign specific responsibility for their implementation. This involves designating an individual or a group within the organization who will be accountable for executing the actions. 

**Key Considerations:**

- **Clear Assignment:** The responsibility should be clearly defined, including the names or roles of those accountable. This ensures that there is no ambiguity about who is responsible for carrying out each action.
  
- **Authority and Resources:** Ensure that the assigned individuals or groups have the necessary authority and resources to implement the recommended actions effectively. Without adequate support, even well-planned actions may fail to achieve the desired outcomes.

- **Target Completion Dates:** Each action should have a specific target completion date. This date serves as a deadline by which the action should be fully implemented. Setting a timeline is crucial for maintaining momentum and ensuring that risk mitigation efforts are timely.

Documenting responsibility and target dates provides a reference point for future users of the FMEA. It allows them to track who was responsible for each action and when it was intended to be completed, facilitating a clear understanding of the process and any subsequent developments.

## Documenting Actions Taken

After an action has been implemented, it is essential to document what was actually done and the date on which it was completed. This step is critical for verifying that the recommended actions were carried out as planned and for assessing their effectiveness.

**Documentation Should Include:**

- **Description of the Action Taken:** Provide a concise but clear description of the actual action that was implemented. This should reflect any adjustments or changes made during implementation.
  
- **Effective Date:** Record the date on which the action was fully implemented. This helps establish a timeline of activities and allows for the tracking of progress over time.

- **Outcome or Results (Optional):** If available, include a brief note on the results or outcomes observed after the action was taken. This could be particularly useful for understanding the impact of the action on the RPN and the overall risk profile.

Proper documentation ensures that future users of the FMEA can track the history of the risk mitigation efforts. It provides transparency and allows for continuous improvement by enabling a review of past actions and their effectiveness.

## Practical Example: Assigning Responsibility, Target Dates, and Documenting Actions

Continuing with the example used previously, the responsibility, target completion dates, and actions taken might be documented as follows:

1. **Failure Mode: No Calls**
   - **Recommended Action:** Implement a voice disaster recovery infrastructure.
   - **Responsibility:** IT Infrastructure Team
   - **Target Completion Date:** October 15, 2024
   - **Action Taken:** Disaster recovery infrastructure implemented as planned. Effective Date: October 15, 2024.

2. **Failure Mode: Call Drops**
   - **Recommended Action:** Conduct a timely review of the escalation matrix.
   - **Responsibility:** Operations Manager
   - **Target Completion Date:** September 30, 2024
   - **Action Taken:** Escalation matrix reviewed and updated. Effective Date: September 30, 2024.

3. **Failure Mode: Bad Connections**
   - **Recommended Action:** Replace faulty headsets.
   - **Responsibility:** Supervisors
   - **Target Completion Date:** August 20, 2024
   - **Action Taken:** All faulty headsets replaced with new ones. Effective Date: August 20, 2024.

4. **Failure Mode: Lower Decibel in Voice Quality**
   - **Recommended Action:** Work with vendor to identify root cause.
   - **Responsibility:** Telephony Team
   - **Target Completion Date:** November 5, 2024
   - **Action Taken:** Vendor identified and resolved the issue. Effective Date: November 5, 2024.

## Activity: Documenting Responsibility, Target Completion Dates, and Actions Taken for Your FMEA

Now, itâ€™s time to apply this to your own FMEA process. Go through the recommended actions you have identified, and for each action, document the following:

- **Who is responsible for implementing the action.**
- **The target completion date for when the action should be implemented.**
- **After implementation, document the actual action taken and its effective date.**

By completing this documentation, you create a robust and traceable record of your risk mitigation efforts, ensuring that the FMEA remains a living document that contributes to continuous improvement within your organization. 

This step is crucial for the long-term success of the FMEA process, as it not only holds individuals accountable but also provides a valuable resource for future assessments and improvements.
