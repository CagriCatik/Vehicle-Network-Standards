# Stage 06: Reevaluating Risk and Visualizing FMEA Rankings

## Overview

In this stage, we focus on the critical task of reevaluating risks and effectively visualizing the rankings within a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). As you have progressed through the earlier stages—understanding the core concepts of FMEA and working through the systematic identification, prioritization, and mitigation of potential failures—you are now equipped to undertake this final, but crucial, step.

## Reevaluating Risk

Reevaluation of risk is a fundamental aspect of the FMEA process. After implementing corrective actions or mitigation strategies identified in previous stages, it is essential to reassess the risk to ensure that the actions have effectively reduced the likelihood or severity of the potential failure modes. This stage ensures that the FMEA remains a living document, continually reflecting the current state of the system or process being analyzed.

### Calculating the Resulting Risk Priority Number (RPN)

The Risk Priority Number (RPN) is a key metric in FMEA, representing the product of three factors:

1. **Severity (S):** The impact of the failure mode on the system, product, or process.
2. **Occurrence (O):** The likelihood that the failure mode will occur.
3. **Detection (D):** The probability that the failure mode will be detected before it causes an impact.

$$ RPN} = S xO xD $$

In the reevaluation phase, after implementing mitigation measures, these factors are reassessed. A new RPN is calculated, reflecting the current risk level. It is important to compare the new RPN with the original one to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented actions.

### Steps to Calculate the Resulting RPN:

1. **Reassess Severity (S):** Determine if the mitigation measures have reduced the severity of the failure mode. Often, the severity remains unchanged unless the nature of the failure mode itself has been altered.
   
2. **Reassess Occurrence (O):** Evaluate whether the likelihood of occurrence has been significantly reduced due to the preventive measures. A lower occurrence rating indicates successful risk mitigation.
   
3. **Reassess Detection (D):** Assess the effectiveness of any new detection methods implemented. Enhanced detection capabilities should lead to a lower detection rating.
   
4. **Compute the New RPN:** Multiply the updated Severity, Occurrence, and Detection values to obtain the new RPN.

The new RPN should guide further decision-making. If the RPN remains unacceptably high, additional actions may be necessary. Conversely, a significantly reduced RPN indicates successful mitigation.

## Visualizing FMEA Rankings

Visualization plays a critical role in effectively communicating the results of an FMEA. It allows stakeholders to quickly grasp the risk landscape and prioritize further actions. One common and effective method for visualizing FMEA rankings is through the use of a **Spiral Chart**.

### Creating a Spiral Chart

A Spiral Chart is an innovative way to represent the distribution of RPN values. It provides a clear, visual ranking of failure modes, where the most critical items (those with the highest RPNs) are easily identifiable.

## Steps to Create a Spiral Chart:

1. **List RPNs in Descending Order:** Start by organizing the failure modes based on their RPN values, from highest to lowest.

2. **Plot the Spiral:** The chart begins at the center, with the most critical failure mode placed at the innermost part of the spiral. Each subsequent failure mode is placed further along the spiral, proportional to its RPN value.

3. **Mark Critical Thresholds:** Use color coding or shading to indicate critical RPN thresholds on the spiral. This helps in visually distinguishing between high, medium, and low-risk areas.

4. **Interpret the Chart:** Analyze the distribution pattern. Clusters of high RPNs in certain areas may indicate systemic issues that require further investigation.

### Advantages of a Spiral Chart:

- **Intuitive Ranking:** It provides an easy-to-understand ranking system.
- **Visual Emphasis on Critical Issues:** The chart naturally draws attention to the highest-risk areas.
- **Compact Representation:** It effectively condenses information, making it ideal for presentations or reports.

## Conclusion

Stage 06 of the FMEA process is pivotal in ensuring that the analysis remains relevant and effective. By reevaluating the risks and recalculating the RPN, you can assess the impact of your mitigation strategies. Visualizing these results through tools like a Spiral Chart further enhances the clarity and utility of the FMEA, enabling better decision-making and communication with stakeholders.

As you conclude this stage, ensure that all updates are thoroughly documented, and revisit earlier stages if the new RPNs suggest that further action is needed. This approach ensures the continuous improvement of your system or process, maintaining its reliability and effectiveness over time.
