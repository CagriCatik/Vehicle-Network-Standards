Once corrective actions have been implemented in response to identified failure modes, it is crucial to reassess and calculate the resulting Risk Priority Number (RPN). This recalculated RPN reflects the effectiveness of the actions taken and provides insight into the current risk status of the system or process under analysis.

## Estimating the Resulting Severity, Occurrence, and Detection Rankings

To accurately calculate the resulting RPN, the following steps should be undertaken:

1. **Reassess Severity (S):**
   - Evaluate whether the corrective actions have altered the potential impact of the failure mode. Typically, severity remains unchanged unless the corrective actions have fundamentally changed the nature of the failure or its consequences.

2. **Reassess Occurrence (O):**
   - Determine if the likelihood of the failure mode occurring has been reduced due to the preventive measures implemented. A lower occurrence rating indicates that the actions taken have effectively decreased the probability of the failure mode.

3. **Reassess Detection (D):**
   - Assess whether the improvements in detection mechanisms have enhanced the ability to identify the failure mode before it results in an impact. An improved detection process should lead to a lower detection rating.

## Recalculating and Recording the Resulting RPN

After the severity, occurrence, and detection rankings have been reassessed, the new RPN can be calculated using the standard formula:

\[ \text{RPN} = S \times O \times D \]

This resulting RPN should then be recorded in the FMEA documentation. It is critical to ensure that this updated RPN is clearly differentiated from the original RPN to avoid any confusion for future users of the document.

## Handling Situations Where No Actions Are Taken

If no corrective actions are implemented for a particular failure mode, it is important to leave the section for the resulting RPN blank. Simply repeating the prior rankings and RPN without modification could lead to misinterpretation by future users, who may mistakenly believe that recommended actions were taken but had no effect. This could undermine the credibility of the FMEA and lead to inappropriate risk management decisions.

In such cases, explicitly stating that no actions were taken, and therefore the RPN remains unchanged, would be a more transparent approach.

## Evaluating the Resulting RPN and Determining Further Actions

Once the resulting RPN has been calculated, it should be thoroughly evaluated to determine whether the risk has been adequately mitigated. If the resulting RPN remains at an unacceptable level, further actions should be considered. This may involve revisiting the recommended actions, exploring alternative solutions, or considering additional mitigation measures.

It is essential to understand that the FMEA process is iterative. The completion of one cycle of action and reevaluation does not necessarily conclude the process. Continuous monitoring and improvement are key to maintaining the reliability and safety of the system or process under analysis.

## Practical Activity: Implementing and Reevaluating FMEA

In practice, once all recommended actions are implemented, you should proceed to reassess the severity, occurrence, and detection rankings and recalculate the RPN accordingly. This exercise is vital in ensuring that your FMEA remains accurate and reflective of the current risk landscape.

## Maintaining the FMEA as a Living Document

The FMEA should not be viewed as a one-time exercise but rather as a living document that requires regular updates. After recalculating the RPN, it is advisable to revisit the FMEA periodically to identify and document any new failure modes that may arise as the system or process evolves.

## Frequency of Revisions

The frequency of FMEA reviews will depend on the nature of your business processes and the rate of change within them. Some organizations may find it beneficial to review their FMEA every three to six months, while others may do so annually. The key is to establish a revision schedule that aligns with the dynamics of your processes.

Regardless of the timeline chosen, the fundamental principle remains that the FMEA must be kept up to date. By doing so, it continues to serve as a reliable tool for risk management, helping to prevent failures and improve overall system reliability.
