# Calculating the Resulting RPN After Corrective Actions

Once corrective actions have been implemented to mitigate identified failure modes, it is essential to reassess and recalculate the Risk Priority Number (RPN). This updated RPN reflects the effectiveness of the corrective measures and provides insight into the current risk level of the system or process. The recalculated RPN helps determine whether further actions are required and ensures that the FMEA remains an accurate, living document.

## Steps for Recalculating the RPN

To calculate the resulting RPN after corrective actions, follow these steps:

### 1. Reassess Severity (S)
- **Objective:**  
  Evaluate whether the corrective actions have altered the potential impact of the failure mode.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Severity typically remains unchanged unless the corrective measures have fundamentally changed the nature or consequences of the failure.
  - If the failure modeâ€™s impact has been reduced (for example, by incorporating fail-safe features), adjust the severity rating accordingly.

### 2. Reassess Occurrence (O)
- **Objective:**  
  Determine if the likelihood of the failure mode occurring has been reduced due to the preventive measures implemented.
- **Considerations:**  
  - Effective preventive actions should lower the occurrence rating.
  - Review historical data, testing results, or process changes to verify any reduction in failure frequency.

### 3. Reassess Detection (D)
- **Objective:**  
  Assess whether improvements in detection mechanisms have enhanced the ability to identify the failure mode before it causes significant harm.
- **Considerations:**  
  - Enhanced detection controls (such as more frequent inspections or better diagnostic tools) should lead to a lower detection rating.
  - Evaluate the reliability of new or updated monitoring processes.

### 4. Calculate the New RPN
- **Formula:**  
  
  `New RPN = S_new  O_new D_new`
  
- **Action:**  
  Multiply the updated ratings for Severity, Occurrence, and Detection to obtain the new RPN.

### 5. Record the Updated RPN
- **Documentation:**  
  Clearly record the new RPN in your FMEA documentation. It is critical to differentiate the updated RPN from the original value to prevent confusion among future users.

## Handling Situations Where No Corrective Actions Are Taken

If no corrective actions are implemented for a specific failure mode, do not simply replicate the previous ratings. Instead:
- **Transparent Documentation:**  
  - Clearly state that no actions were taken, so the original RPN remains unchanged.
  - This approach avoids misinterpretation by future users, who might otherwise assume that actions were taken but proved ineffective.

## Evaluating the Resulting RPN

Once the new RPN is calculated, evaluate it to determine if the risk has been sufficiently mitigated:
- **Acceptable Risk Level:**  
  - If the resulting RPN is significantly lower and within acceptable limits, the corrective actions can be considered effective.
- **Unacceptable Risk Level:**  
  - If the RPN remains high, further investigation and additional corrective actions may be necessary.
- **Iterative Process:**  
  - Recognize that FMEA is iterative; continual monitoring and periodic re-evaluation ensure that the risk management process stays current with evolving system conditions.

## Maintaining the FMEA as a Living Document

Regularly updating your FMEA is vital for ongoing risk management:
- **Scheduled Reviews:**  
  - Establish a revision schedule (e.g., every three to six months or annually) that aligns with the dynamics of your processes.
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  - Use each re-evaluation cycle to identify new failure modes and refine existing mitigation strategies.
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - Ensure that all recalculated RPNs and corrective actions are thoroughly documented to maintain a clear history of risk management efforts.

## Practical Activity: Implementing and Reevaluating Your FMEA

1. **Implement Corrective Actions:**  
   - Execute the recommended actions for each failure mode.
2. **Reassess Ratings:**  
   - Reevaluate the Severity, Occurrence, and Detection ratings post-implementation.
3. **Recalculate the RPN:**  
   - Use the updated ratings to calculate the new RPN.
4. **Record and Compare:**  
   - Document the new RPN alongside the original. Analyze the effectiveness of the corrective actions.
5. **Decide on Next Steps:**  
   - If risks remain high, plan further actions; if not, update the FMEA accordingly.

By following these guidelines for recalculating the RPN after corrective actions, you ensure that your FMEA remains an effective tool for managing risk, enhancing system reliability, and supporting continuous improvement within your organization.
