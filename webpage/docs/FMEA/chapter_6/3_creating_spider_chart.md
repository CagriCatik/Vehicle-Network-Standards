# Creating a Spider Chart for FMEA Visualization

In Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), visualizing the Risk Priority Number (RPN) before and after corrective actions is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of your mitigation strategies. A Spider Chart, also known as a Radar Chart, is an effective tool for this purpose. If you prefer not to use Excel, programming languages like Python or R offer powerful alternatives for creating these charts. Below, we will explore how to create a Spider Chart using Python.

## Option 1: Using Python with Matplotlib

Python's Matplotlib library is widely used for data visualization and offers a straightforward way to create Spider Charts.

1. **Install the Required Libraries:**

   Before creating the chart, ensure you have Matplotlib and NumPy installed. You can install them via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Data:**

   You will need to have your RPN values before and after corrective actions. These values will be used to plot the Spider Chart. For example:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from math import pi

   # Sample data: RPN before and after corrective actions
   categories = ['Failure Mode 1', 'Failure Mode 2', 'Failure Mode 3', 'Failure Mode 4']
   RPN_before = [7, 4, 6, 5]
   RPN_after = [3, 2, 5, 2]
   ```

3. **Create the Spider Chart:**

   Use the following Python code to generate the Spider Chart:

   ```python
   # Number of variables we're plotting
   N = len(categories)

   # Compute angle for each axis
   angles = [n / float(N) * 2 * pi for n in range(N)]
   angles += angles[:1]

   # Initialize the radar chart
   fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6), subplot_kw=dict(polar=True))

   # Draw one axis per variable and add labels
   plt.xticks(angles[:-1], categories)

   # Draw y-labels
   ax.set_rlabel_position(30)
   plt.yticks([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"], color="grey", size=7)
   plt.ylim(0, 7)

   # Plot RPN before corrective actions
   values = RPN_before + RPN_before[:1]
   ax.plot(angles, values, linewidth=2, linestyle='solid', label="RPN Before")
   ax.fill(angles, values, 'b', alpha=0.1)

   # Plot RPN after corrective actions
   values = RPN_after + RPN_after[:1]
   ax.plot(angles, values, linewidth=2, linestyle='solid', label="RPN After")
   ax.fill(angles, values, 'r', alpha=0.1)

   # Add legend
   plt.legend(loc='upper right', bbox_to_anchor=(0.1, 0.1))

   # Display the chart
   plt.show()
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - The `categories` list contains the names of the failure modes or process elements.
     - The `RPN_before` and `RPN_after` lists contain the RPN values before and after corrective actions.
     - The radar chart is initialized with angles calculated to space each category evenly around the chart.
     - The chart is plotted with two lines: one for the initial RPN values and another for the revised values after corrective actions. The area under each line is shaded to enhance visibility.

4. **Analyze the Chart:**

   The resulting Spider Chart will display the RPN values before and after corrective actions, allowing you to visually assess the effectiveness of your risk mitigation strategies. The chart clearly highlights areas where significant risk reduction has been achieved, as well as any failure modes that may require further attention.

## Option 2: Using Python with Plotly

For those who prefer an interactive visualization, Python's Plotly library provides an excellent alternative.

1. **Install Plotly:**

   Install Plotly using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install plotly
   ```

2. **Create the Spider Chart:**

   Use the following code to create an interactive Spider Chart:

   ```python
   import plotly.graph_objects as go

   # Sample data
   categories = ['Failure Mode 1', 'Failure Mode 2', 'Failure Mode 3', 'Failure Mode 4']
   RPN_before = [7, 4, 6, 5]
   RPN_after = [3, 2, 5, 2]

   fig = go.Figure()

   fig.add_trace(go.Scatterpolar(
         r=RPN_before,
         theta=categories,
         fill='toself',
         name='RPN Before'
   ))

   fig.add_trace(go.Scatterpolar(
         r=RPN_after,
         theta=categories,
         fill='toself',
         name='RPN After'
   ))

   fig.update_layout(
     polar=dict(
       radialaxis=dict(
         visible=True,
         range=[0, 7]
       )),
     showlegend=True
   )

   fig.show()
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - The `Scatterpolar` function is used to create the Spider Chart, with `theta` representing the categories and `r` representing the RPN values.
     - The interactive chart allows you to hover over data points for more detailed information, making it a powerful tool for presentations and reports.

## Conclusion

By using Python, you can create robust Spider Charts to visualize FMEA data. Whether you choose Matplotlib for static plots or Plotly for interactive visualizations, these tools provide the flexibility and power needed to effectively communicate risk assessments and improvements. This approach ensures that your FMEA documentation is both technically rigorous and visually compelling, aiding in clear communication with stakeholders and enhancing decision-making processes.
