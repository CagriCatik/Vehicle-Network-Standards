# Stage 01: Identifying the Failure Mode and Specifying its Severity

**Q1: What is Stage 01 in the FMEA process?**  
**A1:** Stage 01 involves identifying all potential failure modes for a system, product, or process and specifying the severity of each failure mode. This foundational step sets the stage for subsequent risk assessments and mitigation efforts.

---

**Q2: What is a failure mode?**  
**A2:** A failure mode is the specific manner in which a component, subsystem, or system can fail to perform its intended function. It represents a deviation from the expected operation, such as a component breaking, a process step being missed, or software malfunctioning.

---

**Q3: Why is identifying failure modes important?**  
**A3:** Identifying failure modes is crucial because it allows teams to proactively recognize potential issues before they occur. This early identification enables targeted risk assessment and the development of corrective actions to improve safety, quality, and overall system reliability.

---

**Q4: How do you specify the severity of a failure mode in FMEA?**  
**A4:** Severity is specified by assessing the potential impact or consequences of a failure mode on the system, product, or process. This is usually done using a numerical rating scale (commonly 1 to 10), where a higher number indicates a more severe impact on safety, performance, or quality.

---

**Q5: What factors are considered when assigning a severity rating?**  
**A5:** Factors include:
- The impact on safety (risk of injury or loss of life).
- The effect on product or process performance.
- The potential for customer dissatisfaction.
- Regulatory or compliance implications.
A failure with catastrophic consequences would receive a high severity rating, even if its occurrence is unlikely.

**Q6: How does a cross-functional team contribute to Stage 01?**  
**A6:** A cross-functional team brings diverse expertise (from design, manufacturing, quality, maintenance, etc.) to the table. This collaborative approach ensures that all potential failure modes are identified comprehensively and that severity ratings are assigned based on a broad spectrum of perspectives and experience.

---

**Q7: How is historical data used in identifying failure modes and specifying severity?**  
**A7:** Historical data, such as past incident reports, warranty claims, and field failure records, provide valuable insights into how and why failures have occurred in the past. This data can help identify recurring failure modes and inform the severity rating by illustrating the real-world consequences of these failures.

---

**Q8: What challenges might arise during the identification of failure modes and specification of severity?**  
**A8:** Challenges include:
- Incomplete identification of all possible failure modes.
- Subjectivity in assigning severity ratings.
- Potential bias if the team relies too heavily on past experiences without considering new or emerging risks.
Using structured methods, checklists, and involving a multidisciplinary team can help mitigate these challenges.

---

**Q9: How does Stage 01 support the overall FMEA process?**  
**A9:** Stage 01 lays the groundwork for the entire FMEA by establishing a comprehensive list of potential failure modes and quantifying their impact through severity ratings. These elements are critical for calculating the Risk Priority Number (RPN) later in the process, which guides prioritization and corrective actions.

---

**Q10: What is the relationship between failure mode identification and subsequent risk mitigation actions?**  
**A10:** The failure modes identified in Stage 01, along with their associated severity ratings, form the baseline for risk assessment. They directly influence the calculation of the RPN (along with occurrence and detection ratings) and, therefore, determine which failure modes require the most urgent corrective actions. Effective identification and severity assessment ensure that mitigation strategies are accurately targeted at the most critical risks.

These Q&A items provide a clear overview of Stage 01 in FMEA, helping ensure that the identification of failure modes and the specification of their severity are carried out methodically to support robust risk management.
