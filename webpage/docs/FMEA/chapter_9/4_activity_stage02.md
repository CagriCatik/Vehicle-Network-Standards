## Question 1

**Question:**  
An occurrence ranking of ten indicates which of the following?  
a) Occurrence is very high. Failure is almost inevitable (1 in 2 instances).  
b) Occurrence is remote. Failure is unlikely (1 in 1.5 million instances).  
c) Occurrence is high. Repeated failures (1 in every 20 instances).  
d) Occurrence is moderate. Occasional failures (1 in 400 instances).

**Correct Answer:**  
**a) Occurrence is very high. Failure is almost inevitable (1 in 2 instances).**

**Explanation:**  
An occurrence ranking of ten represents the highest level on the 1-to-10 scale used in FMEA, meaning that the probability of the failure occurring is extremely highâ€”specifically, failure is expected in 1 out of every 2 instances. This rating flags a critical risk that requires immediate attention and significant mitigation efforts in the FMEA process.

## Question 2

**Question:**  
Occurrence is defined as how frequently a specific failure is projected to occur. It is the chance that one of the specific causes will lead to failure.  
_Is this statement true or false?_

**Correct Answer:**  
**True**

**Explanation:**  
The statement is true. In FMEA, occurrence is indeed defined as the frequency or probability that a specific failure will occur due to a particular cause. This metric is central to risk prioritization, as it helps teams focus on the most probable failure modes, ensuring that resources are directed toward mitigating the risks with the highest likelihood of occurrence.
