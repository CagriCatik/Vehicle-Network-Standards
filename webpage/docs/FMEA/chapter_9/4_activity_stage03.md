# Activity: Stage 03

## Question 1

**Current process controls are descriptions of the controls that either prevent the failure mode from occurring or detect the failure mode if it should occur.**

- **A) True**
- **B) False**

**Correct Answer:** **A) True**

*Explanation:*  
Current process controls include all the mechanisms—whether preventive or detective—that help manage failure modes. They are fundamental in the FMEA process because they either avert the failure altogether or enable early detection if the failure occurs.

## Question 2

**A detectability ranking of 10 indicates that the likelihood of detection is:**

- **A) Remote**
- **B) Absolutely impossible**
- **C) Almost certain**
- **D) None of the above**

**Correct Answer:** **B) Absolutely impossible**

*Explanation:*  
A detectability ranking of 10 reflects the worst-case scenario, where there is less than a 50% probability (often considered effectively 0% in this context) that the failure mode will be detected. This ranking suggests that the detection controls are virtually ineffective.

## Question 3

**A detectability ranking of 1 indicates that the likelihood of detection is:**

- **A) Remote**
- **B) Absolutely impossible**
- **C) Almost certain**
- **D) Unlikely**

**Correct Answer:** **C) Almost certain**

*Explanation:*  
A rating of 1 on the detectability scale means that the process controls are highly effective and will detect the failure mode every time it occurs. This represents the best-case scenario in terms of detectability.

## Question 4

**When assigning a detectability rating, you should:**

- **A) Assume a low detection ranking if occurrences are low.**
- **B) Evaluate the ability of process controls to detect low-frequency failure modes.**
- **C) Automatically assign a low detection ranking if the failure mode is rare.**
- **D) Use the same detectability rating for all failure modes.**

**Correct Answer:** **B) Evaluate the ability of process controls to detect low-frequency failure modes.**

*Explanation:*  
The detectability rating should be determined by analyzing how effective the detection controls are, regardless of the frequency of the failure mode. Even rare failures require a thorough evaluation to ensure they can be detected, rather than making assumptions based solely on their low occurrence.

## Question 5

**The detectability rating is used to:**

- **A) Determine how likely it is that a failure mode will occur.**
- **B) Assess the likelihood that a failure mode will be detected once it has occurred.**
- **C) Measure the severity of a failure mode.**
- **D) Prevent a failure mode from happening.**

**Correct Answer:** **B) Assess the likelihood that a failure mode will be detected once it has occurred.**

*Explanation:*  
Detectability focuses on the effectiveness of process controls in identifying a failure mode after it happens. It is not used to predict how frequently a failure will occur or how severe the failure will be, but rather to evaluate the chance that it will be caught before causing significant harm.

## Question 6

**Which of the following is *not* a factor to consider when assigning a detectability rating?**

- **A) Sensitivity of the detection method**
- **B) Frequency of monitoring**
- **C) Reliability of the detection system**
- **D) Cost of the detection method**

**Correct Answer:** **D) Cost of the detection method**

*Explanation:*  
While factors like sensitivity, frequency of monitoring, and reliability directly affect the effectiveness of detection controls, the cost of the detection method does not impact the detectability rating. The rating should strictly reflect the ability of the control to detect a failure mode.

## Question 7

**In the context of FMEA, why is it important to not automatically assume a low detectability rating for low-occurrence failure modes?**

- **A) Low-occurrence failure modes are not important.**
- **B) Even rare failure modes can have significant impacts if not detected.**
- **C) Low-occurrence failure modes are always detected easily.**
- **D) The detectability rating should always match the occurrence rating.**

**Correct Answer:** **B) Even rare failure modes can have significant impacts if not detected.**

*Explanation:*  
The frequency of occurrence does not diminish the potential impact of a failure if it goes undetected. Even if a failure mode is rare, it may still cause severe consequences if the detection controls are not effective. Hence, each failure mode must be evaluated on the merits of its detection capabilities.
