# Stage 06: Reevaluating the Risk and Visualizing FMEA Rankings

**Q1: What is Stage 06 in the FMEA process?**  
**A1:** Stage 06 involves reevaluating the risks associated with each failure mode after corrective actions have been implemented and visualizing the updated risk rankings. This stage ensures that the FMEA remains current and reflects the systemâ€™s present risk profile.

---

**Q2: Why is reevaluation of risk important in FMEA?**  
**A2:** Reevaluation is crucial because it confirms whether the corrective actions have effectively reduced the risk. It ensures that any changes in severity, occurrence, or detection are captured and that the updated Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs) accurately represent the current state of the system or process.

---

**Q3: How do you calculate the updated RPN during reevaluation?**  
**A3:** The updated RPN is calculated using the same formula as initially: 

    - RPN = S x O X D 

During reevaluation, you reassess each of these ratings based on the effectiveness of the corrective actions and then recompute the RPN.

**Q4: What factors are reassessed when recalculating the RPN?**  
**A4:** The three factors reassessed are:
- **Severity (S):** Whether the corrective actions have altered the impact of the failure mode.
- **Occurrence (O):** Whether the likelihood of the failure mode occurring has been reduced.
- **Detection (D):** Whether improvements in detection controls have enhanced the ability to catch the failure before it causes harm.

**Q5: What does visualizing FMEA rankings involve?**  
**A5:** Visualizing FMEA rankings involves creating graphical representations (such as charts) that display the updated RPN values. This helps stakeholders quickly understand the risk landscape, identify the most critical failure modes, and prioritize further corrective actions.

---

**Q6: What visualization tools are commonly used for FMEA rankings?**  
**A6:** Common tools include:
- **Bar Charts:** To compare RPN values across different failure modes.
- **Scatter Plots:** To show the relationship between severity, occurrence, and detection.
- **Spiral Charts:** An innovative method that places the highest-risk failure modes at the center of the spiral, with decreasing risk levels radiating outward.
These visualizations help in presenting complex data in an easily interpretable format.

---

**Q7: How does a Spiral Chart aid in visualizing FMEA rankings?**  
**A7:** A Spiral Chart starts at the center with the most critical failure mode (highest RPN) and spirals outward with failure modes of decreasing risk. Color coding or shading can be added to highlight critical thresholds, making it easy to identify clusters of high-risk items and target them for further action.

---

**Q8: How does visualization support decision-making in the FMEA process?**  
**A8:** Visualization tools make it easier for stakeholders to understand the distribution and magnitude of risks. By clearly displaying which failure modes have the highest RPNs, decision-makers can prioritize resources, focus on the most urgent issues, and communicate risk levels effectively across the organization.

---

**Q9: Why should the FMEA be maintained as a living document?**  
**A9:** The FMEA must be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in design, process, or operational conditions. Continuous reevaluation ensures that new failure modes are identified, corrective actions remain effective, and the overall risk management strategy stays aligned with the current state of the system.

---

**Q10: What should be done if the updated RPN remains unacceptably high after corrective actions?**  
**A10:** If the new RPN is still high, further corrective actions may be needed. This could involve:
- Reassessing the effectiveness of the current mitigation strategies.
- Implementing additional or alternative actions to further reduce risk.
- Revisiting the ratings for severity, occurrence, and detection to ensure they accurately reflect the current situation.
The iterative nature of FMEA allows continuous improvement until the risk is reduced to acceptable levels.
