## 1. Is it possible to develop perfectly safe systems?

**Answer:**  
No, it is not possible to develop perfectly safe systems. The inherent complexity of modern systems, combined with factors such as costs, effort, and time-to-market constraints, make the achievement of absolute safety unattainable. Additionally, even with highly reliable systems, human error can introduce unforeseen hazards. Therefore, the objective in functional safety is to identify and mitigate risks that are unreasonable and cannot be tolerated, rather than striving for perfection.

## 2. In ISO 26262, what is the unreasonable risk that is in focus caused by?

**Answer:**  
In ISO 26262, the unreasonable risk is primarily caused by the malfunctioning behavior of electrical and electronic systems within road vehicles. This encompasses failures in these systems that could lead to hazardous situations, posing significant threats to human safety. The standard emphasizes identifying and mitigating such risks to ensure that the vehicle operates safely under various conditions throughout its lifecycle.

## 3. When do passive safety systems try to protect human beings?

**Answer:**  
Passive safety systems attempt to protect human beings **during or immediately after a collision**. Unlike active and preventive safety systems, which work to prevent accidents from occurring, passive safety systems activate in the event of an impact to minimize harm. Examples include airbags that inflate to cushion occupants and seatbelts that restrain them to prevent injury during a crash.

## 4. What is availability?

**Answer:**  
**Availability** refers to the readiness of a system to perform its required functions correctly at any given time. In the context of functional safety, high availability ensures that safety-critical systems are operational whenever needed, thereby preventing unsafe conditions that could arise from system downtimes or failures. It is a key aspect of system reliability and overall safety performance.

## 5. What is the main standard for functional safety that was used to derive other standards?

**Answer:**  
The main standard for functional safety that served as the foundation for developing other industry-specific standards is **IEC 61508**. Released in 1998, IEC 61508 provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring the functional safety of electrical, electronic, and programmable electronic safety-related systems. Its principles have been adapted and tailored to various sectors, including automotive (ISO 26262), railway, medical, nuclear, and aerospace industries.

## 6. What types of content can be found in the ISO 26262, second edition?

**Answer:**  
The ISO 26262 second edition comprises two main types of content:

- **Normative Content:**
  - **Definition:** These are mandatory requirements that must be tailored and applied to comply with the standard.
  - **Purpose:** Essential for building the safety case and demonstrating compliance with ISO 26262.
  
- **Informative Content:**
  - **Definition:** Supplementary information that aids in understanding the normative requirements.
  - **Purpose:** Provides context, explanations, and guidance but is not required for compliance.

Additionally, the standard includes tables with methods that are numbered in two ways:
- **Alternative Entries (e.g., 1a, 1b, 1c):** These can be tailored and combined based on the project's strategy.
- **Consecutive Entries (e.g., 1, 2, 3):** These are recommended for use according to Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL).

The standard also outlines guidelines for substituting recommended methods with alternatives, provided that a rationale is given to demonstrate compliance with corresponding requirements.

## 7. Can the ISO 26262, second edition be used to derive security requirements?

**Answer:**  
No, the ISO 26262 second edition is **not designed to derive security requirements**. Functional safety and cybersecurity are distinct disciplines within the automotive safety framework. ISO 26262 focuses on mitigating risks associated with the malfunctioning behavior of electrical and electronic systems to ensure functional safety. On the other hand, cybersecurity addresses the protection of systems against malicious attacks that could compromise functionality and safety.

However, it is essential to integrate functional safety with cybersecurity measures to achieve comprehensive safety and security in automotive systems. While ISO 26262 does not directly provide security requirements, it complements cybersecurity standards by ensuring that safety-critical systems remain reliable and secure against both accidental failures and intentional threats.

# Summary

These answers provide a comprehensive understanding of key concepts in functional safety as defined by ISO 26262. They highlight the limitations in achieving perfect safety, the focus on mitigating unreasonable risks caused by system malfunctions, the roles of different types of safety systems, and the distinction between functional safety and other related disciplines such as cybersecurity. Additionally, the answers clarify the structure and content of ISO 26262, emphasizing the importance of both normative and informative content in achieving compliance and ensuring system safety.
