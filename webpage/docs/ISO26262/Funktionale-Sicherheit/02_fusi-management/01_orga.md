# Organizational Functional Safety

Managing functional safety within an organization is a critical component of adhering to ISO 26262 standards. Effective functional safety management ensures that safety is ingrained at every level of the organization, from overarching cultural values to specific project activities and post-development processes. This documentation explores the multifaceted approach to organizational functional safety, providing detailed explanations, practical examples, and best practices to guide organizations in establishing a robust functional safety framework.

## Perspectives on Functional Safety Management

Functional safety management can be viewed from three primary perspectives:

1. **Organizational Functional Safety**: Manages functional safety at the organizational level, fostering a safety-centric culture.
2. **Functional Safety During Development**: Oversees the functional safety aspects of individual projects or development tasks.
3. **Functional Safety After Development**: Ensures the maintenance of functional safety throughout the product's lifecycle, including production, operation, service, and decommissioning.

Each perspective plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of functional safety across the entire lifecycle of a product.

## Organizational Functional Safety

Focusing on the organizational level, functional safety management encompasses five key areas:

1. **Safety Culture**
2. **Management of Safety Anomalies**
3. **Competence Management**
4. **Building a Quality Management System**
5. **Tailoring the Safety Lifecycle**
