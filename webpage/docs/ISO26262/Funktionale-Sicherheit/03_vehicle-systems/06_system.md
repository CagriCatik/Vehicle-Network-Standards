# System Integration, Verification, and Validation

In the automotive industry, ensuring that a complete system is functional, safe, and compliant with all safety requirements is paramount. The final stages of the V-cycle—**Integration**, **Verification**, and **Validation**—play a critical role in achieving these objectives. This documentation delves into these three steps, providing detailed explanations, practical examples, and best practices to guide the successful delivery of safe and reliable automotive systems in accordance with ISO 26262.

## Objectives of Integration and Testing at the System Level

ISO 26262 outlines three primary objectives for the integration and testing phase at the system level:

1. **Define Integration Steps and Fully Integrate System Elements**
   - **Objective**: Establish a clear plan for integrating all system components until the system is fully assembled.
   - **Activities**:
     - Create an integration plan outlining the sequence and methodology for combining system elements.
     - Incrementally integrate hardware and software components, ensuring each step meets predefined criteria before proceeding.
   
2. **Verify Implementation of Safety Measures**
   - **Objective**: Ensure that all safety measures identified during the safety analysis are correctly implemented.
   - **Activities**:
     - Conduct reviews and inspections of safety mechanisms to confirm proper implementation.
     - Utilize testing methods to validate the functionality and effectiveness of safety measures.
   
3. **Provide Evidence of Compliance with Safety Requirements**
   - **Objective**: Collect and document proof that the integrated system meets all safety requirements as per the system architectural design.
   - **Activities**:
