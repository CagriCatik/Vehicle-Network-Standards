# Faults and failures

In the realm of automotive functional safety, understanding the intricacies of faults and failures is paramount. ISO 26262, the international standard for the functional safety of electrical and electronic systems in road vehicles, provides a comprehensive framework for identifying, categorizing, and mitigating these faults to ensure vehicle safety. This documentation delves into the detailed concepts of faults and failures as defined by ISO 26262, offering clear explanations, practical examples, and best practices to guide automotive engineers in designing safer systems.

## Key Concepts

### Definitions

- **Fault**: A condition in a system component that can lead to a failure. According to IEC 60050, Part 191, a fault is a state that precedes a failure.
  
- **Failure**: An event that occurs when a fault manifests, resulting in the system not performing its intended function.

### Types of Failures

ISO 26262 categorizes failures based on their origin and behavior. Understanding these classifications is essential for implementing effective safety measures.

1. **Random Failures**
   - **Definition**: Failures that occur unpredictably during the lifetime of a hardware element, following a probability distribution.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Limited to hardware elements.
     - Cannot be prevented; only detected and controlled.
     - Have a specific failure rate and failure mode.
   - **Handling**:
     - Implement safety mechanisms to detect and mitigate these failures in real-time.

2. **Systematic Failures**
   - **Definition**: Failures related deterministically to a specific cause, such as design flaws or manufacturing defects.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Applicable to hardware, software, and processes.
     - Can be eliminated through changes in design, manufacturing, or operational procedures.
   - **Handling**:
     - Implement safety measures to prevent, detect, or control these failures through robust design and quality assurance processes.

## Failure Rates and Failure Modes

### Failure Rate

- **Definition**: The probability of a hardware element failing, expressed as FIT (Failures In Time).
  - **1 FIT** = 1 failure per billion (10‚Åπ) hours of operation.
  
- **Calculation**: According to ISO 26262, the failure rate is the probability density of failure divided by the probability of survival for a hardware element.

### Failure Mode

- **Definition**: The manner in which an element or system fails to perform its intended function.
  
- **Examples**:
  - **Open Circuit**: A break in the circuit causing it to stop conducting.
  - **Short Circuit**: An unintended connection between two points in the circuit.
  - **Stuck-at Fault**: A signal line that is stuck at a logical high or low value.

## Safety Mechanisms and Diagnostic Coverage

### Safety Mechanism

- **Definition**: A technical solution implemented by electrical/electronic functions or elements to detect and mitigate faults, control or avoid failures, and maintain intended functionality or achieve a safe state.
  
- **Examples**:
  - **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: Ensures data integrity.
  - **Watchdog Timers**: Detect unresponsive hardware or software components.
  - **Redundant Sensors**: Provide backup data in case of sensor failure.

### Diagnostic Coverage

- **Definition**: The percentage of the failure rate of a hardware element or failure mode that is detected or controlled by the implemented safety mechanism.
  
- **Standard Coverage Rates**:
  - **60%**
  - **90%**
  - **99%**
  
- **Importance**: Determines the effectiveness of safety mechanisms in identifying and mitigating faults.

## Classification of Faults

ISO 26262 further classifies faults based on their impact and behavior within the system.

### Single Point Faults

- **Definition**: Faults in a single hardware element without any safety mechanism, leading directly to the violation of a safety goal.
  
- **Example**: An unsupervised resistor stuck in an open state that can disrupt the steering mechanism.

### Residual Faults

- **Definition**: Portions of random hardware faults not covered by safety mechanisms, potentially leading to safety goal violations.
  
- **Example**: A torque sensor with a safety mechanism that only detects "stuck at open" faults, leaving "stuck at short" faults as residual.

### Latent Dual Point Faults (Latent Faults)

- **Definition**: Multiple faults that are not detected by safety mechanisms or perceived by the driver within a specified time interval, leading to safety goal violations only when combined.
  
- **Example**: 
  - **Scenario**: A microcontroller and its watchdog timer both fail, preventing the system from detecting and responding to a critical sensor fault.

### Detected Dual Point Faults

- **Definition**: Multiple faults where at least one fault is detected by a safety mechanism, preventing the combination from violating safety goals.
  
- **Example**: 
  - **Scenario**: A flash memory protected by ECC (Error Correction Code) fails, but the ECC logic detects the fault and triggers a safe state transition.

### Perceived Dual Point Faults

- **Definition**: Multiple faults that are detected or perceived by the driver within a specified time interval, preventing the combination from violating safety goals.
  
- **Example**: 
  - **Scenario**: Both a steering sensor and its safety mechanism fail, but the driver perceives the steering issue and takes corrective action.

### Safe Faults

- **Definition**: Faults that do not significantly increase the probability of violating a safety goal.
  
- **Characteristics**:
  - Can occur in both safety-relevant and non-safety-relevant hardware elements.
  - Typically, non-safety-relevant components should only have safe faults.
  
- **Exception**:
  - **Triple Point Faults**: Faults involving three independent elements are considered safe due to their low probability.

## Failure Rate Standards

To determine failure rates and failure modes, ISO 26262 recommends using established standards:

- **IEC 61709**
  - **Description**: Provides methods for determining failure rates of electrical and electronic components.
  
- **SN 29500** (Less Accessible)
  - **Description**: Another standard for deriving failure rates, though less commonly used due to accessibility issues.
  
- **IEC 61508**
  - **Description**: A broader functional safety standard applicable to various industries, offering principles used in ISO 26262.

## Diagnostic Coverage Evaluation

### Annex D of ISO 26262 Part 5

- **Content**: Provides tables and guidelines to evaluate the diagnostic coverage of safety mechanisms.
  
- **Usage**: Helps determine the appropriate diagnostic coverage rates (60%, 90%, 99%) for different safety mechanisms based on their roles and the associated failure rates.

### Example: Fault Injection Testing

- **Objective**: Verify the effectiveness of safety mechanisms by simulating faults.
  
- **Procedure**:
  - Introduce voltage anomalies to sensor inputs (e.g., feed the sensor +5.5V for 10 seconds).
  - Test if the monitoring mechanism detects the anomaly (e.g., detecting 6V, 7V, 8V).

## Classification Based on Root Cause

1. **Common Cause Failures**
   - **Definition**: Failures of two or more elements resulting directly from a specific event or root cause.
   - **Example**: A fault in the cooling system leading to multiple systemic failures due to overtemperature.

2. **Cascading Failures**
   - **Definition**: A failure in one element causes a failure in another element.
   - **Example**: Failure of one transistor in a parallel configuration causing excessive load on another, leading to its failure.

3. **Dependent Failures**
   - **Definition**: Failures that are not statistically independent, where the combined probability of failure is not the product of individual probabilities.
   - **Includes**:
     - Common Cause Failures
     - Cascading Failures

## Permanent vs. Transient Faults

1. **Permanent Faults**
   - **Definition**: Faults that occur and remain until they are removed or repaired.
   - **Examples**: "Stuck at," "open," "short," "drift."

2. **Transient Faults**
   - **Definition**: Faults that occur temporarily and disappear without intervention.
   - **Examples**: Bit flips, electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues.

### Handling Transient Faults
