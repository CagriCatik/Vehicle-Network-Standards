# Hardware safety analyses

In the automotive industry's pursuit of functional safety, hardware safety analysis stands as a pivotal activity, second only to hazard analysis and risk assessment. ISO 26262, the international standard for functional safety of electrical and electronic systems in road vehicles, provides comprehensive guidelines to ensure that hardware components perform reliably and safely under all conditions. This documentation offers an in-depth exploration of hardware safety analyses as outlined by ISO 26262, complete with clear explanations, practical examples, and best practices to guide automotive engineers in designing robust and safe hardware systems.

## Importance of Hardware Safety Analysis

Hardware safety analysis is critical for several reasons:

- **Dual Nature of Faults**: The hardware domain encompasses both systematic and random faults, necessitating comprehensive coverage of both failure types.
- **Safety Goal Protection**: Ensures that potential hardware faults do not lead to the violation of safety goals.
- **Compliance Assurance**: Facilitates adherence to ISO 26262 standards, ensuring that safety requirements are systematically met.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies and mitigates risks associated with hardware failures, enhancing overall system reliability and safety.

## Types of Faults and Failures

Understanding the different types of faults and failures is fundamental to effective hardware safety analysis. ISO 26262 classifies faults based on their origin, behavior, and impact on safety goals.

### 1. Single Point Faults

- **Definition**: Faults in a single hardware element without any safety mechanism, directly leading to the violation of a safety goal.
- **Example**: A resistor stuck in an open state disrupting the steering mechanism.
- **Impact**: Can render the system non-compliant with ISO 26262 if not properly mitigated.

### 2. Residual Faults

- **Definition**: Portions of random hardware faults not covered by safety mechanisms, potentially leading to safety goal violations.
- **Example**: A torque sensor with a safety mechanism that only detects "stuck at open" faults, leaving "stuck at short" faults as residual.
- **Impact**: Residual faults require additional safety measures to prevent safety goal violations.

### 3. Latent Dual Point Faults (Latent Faults)

- **Definition**: Multiple faults that are neither detected by safety mechanisms nor perceived by the driver within a specified time interval, leading to safety goal violations only when combined.
- **Example**: A microcontroller and its watchdog timer both fail, preventing the system from detecting and responding to a critical sensor fault.
- **Impact**: These faults are particularly dangerous as they bypass existing safety mechanisms.

### 4. Detected Dual Point Faults

- **Definition**: Multiple faults where at least one fault is detected by a safety mechanism, preventing the combination from violating safety goals.
- **Example**: A flash memory protected by ECC (Error Correction Code) fails, but the ECC logic detects the fault and triggers a safe state transition.
- **Impact**: Enhances system reliability by ensuring that combined faults do not compromise safety goals.

### 5. Perceived Dual Point Faults

- **Definition**: Multiple faults detected or perceived by the driver within a specified time interval, preventing the combination from violating safety goals.
- **Example**: Both a steering sensor and its safety mechanism fail, but the driver perceives the steering issue and takes corrective action.
- **Impact**: Allows the driver to intervene, maintaining system safety despite multiple faults.

### 6. Safe Faults

- **Definition**: Faults that do not significantly increase the probability of violating a safety goal.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Can occur in both safety-relevant and non-safety-relevant hardware elements.
  - Typically, non-safety-relevant components should only exhibit safe faults.
- **Exception**: Triple Point Faults are considered safe due to their low probability.
- **Impact**: Do not compromise system safety, ensuring smooth and reliable operation.

### 7. Permanent vs. Transient Faults

- **Permanent Faults**:
  - **Definition**: Faults that occur and remain until they are removed or repaired.
  - **Examples**: "Stuck at," "open," "short," "drift."
  - **Handling**: Require mechanisms for detection and mitigation to prevent safety goal violations.

- **Transient Faults**:
  - **Definition**: Faults that occur temporarily and disappear without intervention.
  - **Examples**: Bit flips, electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues.
  - **Handling**: Implement safety mechanisms to detect and react to transient faults promptly.

## Safety Analysis Methods

ISO 26262 recommends several safety analysis methods, each suited to different aspects of hardware development. These methods can be categorized based on their analytical approach and whether they are qualitative or quantitative.

### 1. Qualitative Safety Analysis

Qualitative analysis focuses on identifying potential failures and their effects without quantifying their probabilities. This approach is essential during the early design phases to ensure comprehensive hazard identification and mitigation.

  - **Steer-by-Wire System**:
    - **Deviation**: "No" steering input detected.
    - **Hazard**: Loss of steering control.
    - **Mitigation**: Implement redundant sensors and fail-safe mechanisms.

### 2. Quantitative Safety Analysis

Quantitative analysis involves numerical evaluation of failure rates and probabilities, providing a measurable assessment of system reliability and safety.

#### Failure Modes, Effects, and Diagnostic Analysis (FMEDA)

- **Definition**: An extension of FMEA that incorporates quantitative aspects, such as failure rates and diagnostic coverage, to assess the reliability of safety mechanisms.
- **Developed By**: Exida, a global leader in functional safety.
- **Best Practices**:
  - **Integrate with FMEA**: Combine FMEDA with FMEA to enhance depth of analysis.

### FMEDA Steps

1. **Establish Bill of Materials (BOM)**:
   - List all hardware elements involved in the steer-by-wire system, including sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and monitoring units.

2. **Identify Failure Modes and Rates**:
   - For each hardware element, determine potential failure modes and assign failure rates based on standards like IEC 61709.
   - **Example**:
     - **R3 (Temperature Sensor)**:
       - **Failure Modes**: Stuck-at-open, drift.
       - **Failure Rate**: 2 FIT (1 FIT for each failure mode).
     - **I71 (Actuator Control Unit)**:
       - **Failure Modes**: Stuck-at-short, failure to respond.
       - **Failure Rate**: 1 FIT (0.5 FIT for each failure mode).

3. **Determine Failure Distribution**:
   - Allocate the failure rate of each hardware element to its failure modes based on standard distributions.
   - **Example**:
     - **R3**:
       - Stuck-at-open: 50% (1 FIT)
       - Drift: 50% (1 FIT)
     - **I71**:
       - Stuck-at-short: 50% (0.5 FIT)
       - Failure to respond: 50% (0.5 FIT)

4. **Assign Safety Mechanisms**:
   - Link each failure mode to relevant safety mechanisms and assign diagnostic coverage rates.
   - **Example**:
     - **R3 Stuck-at-open**:
       - **Safety Mechanism**: CRC (80% diagnostic coverage)
     - **I71 Stuck-at-short**:
       - **Safety Mechanism**: Watchdog Timer (60% diagnostic coverage)

5. **Calculate Residual FIT**:
   - For each failure mode, calculate the residual FIT after applying diagnostic coverage.
   - **Formula**: Residual FIT = Failure Rate × (1 - Diagnostic Coverage)
   - **Example**:
     - **R3 Stuck-at-open**: 1 FIT × (1 - 0.8) = 0.2 FIT
     - **I71 Stuck-at-short**: 0.5 FIT × (1 - 0.6) = 0.2 FIT

6. **Evaluate Metrics**:
   - **Single Point Fault Metric (SPFm)**:
     - SPFm = (Total Residual FIT for SPFs / Total FIT for Safety-Related Components) × 100
     - SPFm = (0.2 + 0.2) / 4 × 100 = 10%
     - **Compliance**: For ASIL B, SPFm should be ≥ 60%. This indicates non-compliance, necessitating additional safety measures.
   - **Latent Fault Metric (LFm)**:
     - LFm = (Total Residual FIT for Latent Faults / Total FIT for Safety-Related Components) × 100
     - LFm = 0% (no latent faults identified)
     - **Compliance**: For ASIL B, LFm should be ≥ 60%. This indicates compliance.

7. **Implement Mitigations**:
   - Based on metric evaluations, enhance safety mechanisms to achieve compliance.
   - **Example**:
     - **Increase CRC Diagnostic Coverage**: Upgrade CRC to 90% for R3.
     - **Enhance Watchdog Timer**: Improve diagnostic coverage to 80% for I71.

8. **Recalculate Metrics**:
   - **SPFm** = (0.2 × 1 + 0.2 × 1) / 4 × 100 = 10% (Still non-compliant)
   - **Additional Measures**:
     - Introduce redundant sensors or implement fail-safe mechanisms to further reduce residual FIT.

## Handling Random Failures

### Designing Safety Mechanisms

To effectively handle random failures, implement safety mechanisms that can:

- **Detect Faults**: Real-time monitoring systems to identify faults as they occur.
- **Mitigate Faults**: Transition the system to a safe state within the Fault Tolerant Time Interval (FTTI) once a fault is detected.
- **Examples**:
  - **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: Ensures data integrity.
  - **Watchdog Timers**: Detect unresponsive components.
  - **Redundant Sensors**: Provide backup data to prevent single sensor failures from compromising safety.

### Example: Fault Injection Testing

- **Objective**: Verify the effectiveness of safety mechanisms by simulating faults.
- **Procedure**:
  - Introduce voltage anomalies to sensor inputs (e.g., apply +5.5V to a sensor for 10 seconds).
  - Assess if the monitoring mechanism detects the anomaly (e.g., detects voltages at 6V, 7V, 8V).
- **Outcome**: Confirm that safety mechanisms respond appropriately to simulated faults.

## Root Cause-Based Classification

Understanding the root causes of failures aids in implementing effective safety measures.

### Common Cause Failures

- **Definition**: Failures of two or more elements resulting directly from a specific event or root cause.
- **Example**: A fault in the cooling system leading to multiple systemic failures due to overtemperature.

### Cascading Failures

- **Definition**: A failure in one element causes a failure in another element.
- **Example**: Failure of one transistor in a parallel configuration causing excessive load on another, leading to its failure.

### Dependent Failures

- **Definition**: Failures that are not statistically independent, where the combined probability of failure is not the product of individual probabilities.
- **Includes**:
  - Common Cause Failures
  - Cascading Failures
- **Impact**: Increases the likelihood of multiple simultaneous failures, posing significant safety risks.
