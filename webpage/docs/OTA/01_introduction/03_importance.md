This ensures that updates are applied during periods of low activity, minimizing user disruption and optimizing bandwidth usage.

*Example: Update Scheduling Algorithm Pseudocode*

```python
def schedule_update(vehicle_status, network_conditions):
    if vehicle_status['is_idle'] and network_conditions['bandwidth_available']:
        return schedule_time(current_time + preferred_delay)
    else:
        return schedule_time(next_available_window)
```

### 2. **Delta and Incremental Updates**

To address bandwidth constraints and reduce data transmission overhead, OTA systems employ delta and incremental update mechanisms. These methods involve transmitting only the changes between software versions rather than the entire software package, significantly decreasing the size of update downloads.

*Example: Delta Update Process*

```bash
# Generate a delta patch between old and new firmware versions
bsdiff old_firmware.bin new_firmware.bin update_patch.bsdiff

# Apply the delta patch to update firmware
bspatch old_firmware.bin updated_firmware.bin update_patch.bsdiff
```

### 3. **Efficient Compression Algorithms**

Advanced compression algorithms are utilized to further minimize the size of update packages, ensuring efficient use of available bandwidth and reducing download times.

*Example: Compression Implementation Using zlib*

```c
#include <zlib.h>

bool compress_update_data(uint8_t *input, size_t input_size, uint8_t *output, size_t *output_size) {
    z_stream strm = {0};
    strm.total_in = strm.avail_in = input_size;
    strm.total_out = strm.avail_out = *output_size;
    strm.next_in = input;
    strm.next_out = output;

    if (deflateInit(&strm, Z_BEST_COMPRESSION) != Z_OK)
        return false;

    if (deflate(&strm, Z_FINISH) != Z_STREAM_END) {
        deflateEnd(&strm);
        return false;
    }

    *output_size = strm.total_out;
    deflateEnd(&strm);
    return true;
}
```

#include "crypto.h"
#include "network.h"

// Encrypt update data before transmission
bool encrypt_and_send_update(uint8_t *update_data, size_t update_size, const char *destination) {
    uint8_t encrypted_data[MAX_UPDATE_SIZE];
    size_t encrypted_size;

    if (!encrypt_data(update_data, update_size, encrypted_data, &encrypted_size)) {
        log_error("Data encryption failed.");
        return false;
    }

    if (!network_send(encrypted_data, encrypted_size, destination)) {
        log_error("Failed to send encrypted update data.");

    uint8_t backup_firmware[MAX_FIRMWARE_SIZE];
    size_t backup_size;

    // Load backup firmware from secure storage
    if (!storage_read("backup_firmware.bin", backup_firmware, &backup_size)) {
        log_error("Failed to read backup firmware.");
        return false;
    }

    // Verify backup firmware integrity
    if (!verify_firmware_integrity(backup_firmware, backup_size)) {
        log_error("Backup firmware integrity check failed.");
        return false;
    }

    // Apply backup firmware
    if (!apply_ecu_firmware_update(backup_firmware, backup_size)) {
        log_error("Failed to apply backup firmware.");
        return false;
    }

    log_info("Firmware rollback successful.");
    return true;
}
```
