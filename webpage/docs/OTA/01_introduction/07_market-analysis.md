#include "partition_manager.h"
#include "firmware.h"

// Function to switch between A and B partitions
bool switch_partition(int current_partition) {
    int new_partition = (current_partition == PARTITION_A) ? PARTITION_B : PARTITION_A;
    
    if (!set_active_partition(new_partition)) {
        log_error("Failed to switch to partition %d.", new_partition);
        return false;
    }
    
    log_info("Switched to partition %d successfully.", new_partition);
    return true;
}

// Function to apply firmware update using A/B partitioning
bool apply_firmware_update(uint8_t *firmware_data, size_t firmware_size, int current_partition) {
    int inactive_partition = (current_partition == PARTITION_A) ? PARTITION_B : PARTITION_A;
    
    // Write firmware to inactive partition
    if (!write_firmware(inactive_partition, firmware_data, firmware_size)) {
        log_error("Failed to write firmware to partition %d.", inactive_partition);
        return false;
    }
    
    // Validate firmware integrity
    if (!validate_firmware(inactive_partition)) {
        log_error("Firmware validation failed for partition %d.", inactive_partition);
        return false;
    }
    
    // Switch to inactive partition
    if (!switch_partition(current_partition)) {
        log_error("Failed to switch partitions.");
        return false;
    }
    
    log_info("Firmware update applied successfully to partition %d.", inactive_partition);
    return true;
}
```
