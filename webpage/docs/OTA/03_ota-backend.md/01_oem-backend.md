# OEM Backend 

The OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) Backend is a critical component in the vehicle ecosystem, facilitating the seamless management of software updates, device configurations, and campaign executions. It serves as the central hub where development teams upload binaries, manage device-specific parameters, and oversee the deployment of updates across the vehicle fleet. This documentation provides an in-depth exploration of the three primary elements of the OEM Backend: Update Management, Device Management, and Campaign Management. Each section delves into the functionalities, processes, and technical considerations essential for advanced users aiming to optimize and maintain robust backend operations.

## Update Management

### Overview

Update Management is responsible for orchestrating the entire lifecycle of software updates within the vehicle architecture. This includes the uploading of binary files from the development and engineering teams to the cloud server, configuring update parameters, and ensuring that updates are communicated effectively to the relevant devices.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Binary Uploading:**
   - **Source:** Binaries are sourced from the development and engineering teams, representing the latest software versions deemed suitable for deployment.
   - **Process:** The binaries, often in the form of HEX files or firmware packages, are uploaded to the cloud server through a secure interface.
   
2. **Configuration:**
   - **Issue Identification:** Define the specific issues or enhancements that the update addresses.
   - **Communication Protocols:** Determine how updates are communicated to the vehicles, ensuring compatibility with existing communication frameworks.
   - **File Management:** Organize and store the relevant files in the cloud, categorizing them based on device compatibility, software version, and deployment priority.

### Workflow

```python
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError

def upload_binary(file_path, bucket_name, object_name=None):
    """
    Uploads a binary file to the specified S3 bucket.

    :param file_path: Path to the binary file.
    :param bucket_name: Name of the S3 bucket.
    :param object_name: S3 object name. If not specified, file_path is used.
    :return: True if file was uploaded, else False.
    """
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    if object_name is None:
        object_name = file_path.split('/')[-1]
    
    try:
        s3_client.upload_file(file_path, bucket_name, object_name)
        print(f"Upload Successful: {object_name}")
        return True
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("The file was not found.")
        return False
    except NoCredentialsError:
        print("Credentials not available.")
        return False

# Example usage
upload_binary('path/to/firmware.hex', 'oem-backend-bucket', 'firmwares/firmware_v1.2.hex')
```
