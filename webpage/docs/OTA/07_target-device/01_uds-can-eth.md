# UDS over CAN vs. UDS over Ethernet in OTA

In the rapidly evolving automotive landscape, **Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS)** has become a cornerstone for vehicle diagnostics and firmware updates. As vehicles transition towards more complex electronic architectures, the underlying communication protocols that facilitate UDS—**Controller Area Network (CAN)** and **Ethernet**—play pivotal roles in ensuring efficient and reliable Over-the-Air (OTA) updates. This documentation provides a comprehensive analysis of **UDS over CAN** versus **UDS over Ethernet**, highlighting their architectural differences, advantages, limitations, and practical implementations. Advanced users and industry professionals will gain in-depth insights into optimizing diagnostic and update processes within modern vehicles.

## Overview of UDS

**Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS)** is a diagnostic communication protocol used in automotive electronics for tasks such as vehicle diagnostics, firmware updates, and system configurations. UDS operates on the application layer of the OSI model, providing standardized services that facilitate communication between diagnostic testers and Electronic Control Units (ECUs).

## UDS over CAN

### Architecture

**UDS over CAN** integrates UDS into the traditional CAN communication stack, which is prevalent in automotive systems for its robustness and simplicity. The architecture comprises three primary layers:

1. **UDS Application Layer:**
   - Defines diagnostic services and message structures.
   - Handles service requests and responses between diagnostic tools and ECUs.

2. **CAN Transport Layer:**
   - Manages message framing, segmentation, and reassembly.
   - Ensures reliable data transfer over the CAN network.

3. **CAN Physical Layer:**
   - Facilitates electrical signaling and physical transmission of CAN frames.
   - Operates at data rates up to **1 Mbps**.

### Implementation

Implementing UDS over CAN involves configuring ECUs to communicate using CAN bus protocols and adhering to UDS service specifications. Below is an illustrative example in **C** demonstrating a basic UDS service handler over CAN.

```c
#include "can.h"
#include "uds.h"
#include "logger.h"

// Define CAN identifiers
#define CAN_ID_REQUEST 0x7DF
#define CAN_ID_RESPONSE 0x7E8

// UDS Service Handler
void handle_uds_request(CanMessage *msg) {
    if (msg->id != CAN_ID_REQUEST) {
        return;
    }

    uint8_t service_id = msg->data[0];
    switch (service_id) {
        case 0x10: // Diagnostic Session Control
            // Handle Diagnostic Session Control
            send_uds_response(CAN_ID_RESPONSE, 0x50, 0x01); // Example response
            break;
        case 0x22: // Read Data by Identifier
            // Handle Read Data by Identifier
            send_uds_response(CAN_ID_RESPONSE, 0x62, 0xF1); // Example response
            break;
        // Add additional UDS services as needed
        default:
            send_negative_response(CAN_ID_RESPONSE, 0x7F, 0x31); // Service Not Supported
            break;
    }
}

// Function to send UDS positive response
void send_uds_response(uint32_t id, uint8_t response_id, uint8_t data) {
    CanMessage response;
    response.id = id;
    response.length = 3;
    response.data[0] = response_id;
    response.data[1] = data;
    response.data[2] = 0x00; // Padding or additional data
    can_send(&response);
}

// Function to send UDS negative response
void send_negative_response(uint32_t id, uint8_t response_id, uint8_t error_code) {
    CanMessage response;
    response.id = id;
    response.length = 3;
    response.data[0] = response_id;
    response.data[1] = error_code;
    response.data[2] = 0x00; // Padding or additional data
    can_send(&response);
}

// CAN Receive Callback
void on_can_receive(CanMessage *msg) {
    handle_uds_request(msg);
}

int main() {
    can_init();
    uds_init();
    logger_init();

    can_set_receive_callback(on_can_receive);

    while (1) {
