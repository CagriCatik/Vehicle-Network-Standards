# Diagnostics over Ethernet and CAN in AUTOSAR

In modern automotive systems, efficient and reliable diagnostics are paramount for ensuring vehicle safety, performance, and maintainability. Diagnostics over Ethernet and Controller Area Network (CAN) are two prevalent methods employed within the AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) framework to facilitate communication between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and diagnostic tools. This document provides a comprehensive exploration of diagnostics over Ethernet and CAN within the AUTOSAR architecture, delving into their underlying mechanisms, architectural components, and implementation specifics.

## Overview of AUTOSAR

### What is AUTOSAR?

AUTOSAR, standing for Automotive Open System Architecture, is a globally recognized development partnership established in 2003 by leading automotive OEMs such as BMW, Volkswagen (VW), Daimler, Bosch, and PSA. The consortium aims to standardize automotive software architecture to promote interoperability, scalability, and reusability across the automotive industry. By decoupling software from hardware, AUTOSAR enables OEMs and suppliers to interchange software components without being tethered to specific hardware platforms or tier-one suppliers.

### AUTOSAR Architecture

The AUTOSAR architecture is stratified into several layers, each responsible for distinct functionalities. Understanding these layers is crucial for comprehending how diagnostics over Ethernet and CAN are integrated and managed within the system.

#### Application Layer

The Application Layer is the topmost layer in the AUTOSAR architecture. It hosts custom functionalities and software components essential for vehicle operations. Examples of software components include:

- **Emergency Braking**
- **Lane Keep Assist**
- **Cruise Control**

These components interact with the underlying layers through standardized interfaces, ensuring seamless communication and integration.

#### Runtime Environment (RTE)

Positioned below the Application Layer, the Runtime Environment (RTE) serves as an intermediary, facilitating communication between application software and the Basic Software (BSW). It provides standardized ports and interfaces, enabling software components to interact with the BSW without direct dependencies.

**Key Functions of RTE:**

- **Communication Services:** Facilitates data exchange between software components and hardware.
- **ECU-Dependent Interfaces:** Manages interactions specific to individual ECUs.
- **Inter-ECU Communication:** Enables communication within and across ECUs.

#### Basic Software (BSW)

The Basic Software layer constitutes the foundational software modules essential for hardware abstraction and system services. It is further subdivided into three primary layers:

1. **Service Layer**
2. **Abstraction Layer**
3. **Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL)**

##### Service Layer

The Service Layer is the uppermost segment of the BSW, providing essential services that support both application and lower-level software components. It abstracts hardware and microcontroller functionalities, offering a standardized interface to the rest of the system.

**Services Provided:**

- **Operating System Functionality**
- **Vehicle Network Communication**
- **Management Services:**
  - NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory) Services
  - Diagnostic Services (e.g., Read Diagnostic Services - RDS)
  - Error Handling
  - ECU State Management
  - ECU Mode Management
  - Logical Operations
  - Temporal Program Flow Monitoring

**Security Services:**

While the Service Layer also encompasses security-related functionalities such as the Crypto Stack Manager (CSM), this documentation focuses primarily on communication protocols, excluding cybersecurity elements.

##### Abstraction Layer

The Abstraction Layer serves as a bridge between the Service Layer and the Microcontroller Abstraction Layer. It provides hardware-independent interfaces for communication protocols, ensuring that upper layers can interact with various hardware components uniformly.

**Key Components:**

- **CAN Interface (CanIf)**
- **Ethernet Interface (EthIf)**
- **FlexRay Interface (FrIf)**

These interfaces abstract the specific features and functionalities of underlying hardware, enabling seamless integration and interoperability.

##### Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL)

The MCAL is the lowest layer of the BSW, directly interfacing with the microcontroller hardware. It encapsulates hardware-specific drivers and services, providing a consistent API for higher layers.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Physical Communications:** Manages interactions with communication buses (e.g., CAN, Ethernet).
- **Cryptographic Operations:** Handles security-related processes at the hardware level.
- **Complex Device Drivers (CDD):** Facilitates specialized interactions with complex sensors and actuators that may not conform to standard AUTOSAR interfaces.

**Example of MCAL in Action:**

```c
// Example: Initializing CAN Controller in MCAL
Can_InitType canInit;
canInit.baudrate = CAN_BAUD_500K;
canInit.mode = CAN_MODE_NORMAL;
Can_Init(&canInit);
```

## Diagnostics over CAN

### CAN Diagnostics Overview

CAN is a robust vehicle bus standard designed to facilitate communication among ECUs without a host computer. In diagnostics, CAN enables the transmission of diagnostic messages that aid in vehicle troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and maintenance.

### CAN Messages

CAN messages are fundamental units of communication on the CAN bus. Each message consists of an identifier and up to eight bytes of data. For diagnostics, messages are structured to convey specific information or commands.

**Basic CAN Frame Structure:**

- **Identifier:** Determines the priority and type of the message.
- **Control Field:** Specifies the length and type of the data.
- **Data Field:** Contains the actual diagnostic data (up to 8 bytes).
- **CRC Field:** Ensures data integrity.
- **ACK Field:** Confirms successful receipt of the message.

### CAN Transport Protocol (CAN TP)

While CAN frames are limited to eight bytes of data, diagnostic operations often require the transmission of larger payloads. The CAN Transport Protocol (CAN TP), defined by ISO 15765, extends CAN's capabilities to handle segmented and multiplexed messages.

#### ISO 15765 Frame Types

1. **Single Frame (SF):** Transmits an entire message within a single CAN frame.
2. **First Frame (FF):** Initiates the transmission of a segmented message.
3. **Consecutive Frame (CF):** Continues the transmission of a segmented message.
4. **Flow Control Frame (FC):** Manages the flow of segmented frames, providing acknowledgments and controlling the transmission rate.

**Example of a Single Frame:**

```plaintext
| SF | Length | Data (up to 7 bytes) |
|----|--------|----------------------|
| 0x0 | 0x07   | 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x00, 0x01, 0x02 |
```

**Example of a First Frame:**

```plaintext
| FF | Length | Data (up to 6 bytes) |
|-----|--------|----------------------|
| 0x1 | 0x0A   | 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x00, 0x01 |
```

**Example of a Consecutive Frame:**

```plaintext
| CF | Sequence Number | Data (up to 7 bytes) |
|-----|------------------|----------------------|
| 0x2 | 0x01             | 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09 |
```

**Example of a Flow Control Frame:**

```plaintext
| FC | Flow Status | Block Size | Separation Time |
|-----|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0x3 | 0x00        | 0x00       | 0x00            |
```

#### Data Transmission Workflow

1. **Initiation:** The diagnostic tool sends a First Frame (FF) to initiate a segmented message.
2. **Flow Control:** The ECU responds with a Flow Control (FC) frame to manage the transmission rate and acknowledge receipt.
3. **Consecutive Frames:** The diagnostic tool sends Consecutive Frames (CF) as per the flow control instructions.
4. **Completion:** The ECU processes the received data and responds accordingly.

**CAN TP Implementation Example:**

```c
// Example: Sending a segmented diagnostic message using CAN TP
CanTp_PduType canTpPdu;
canTpPdu.id = 0x7DF; // Diagnostic Request ID
canTpPdu.length = 20; // Total length of the diagnostic message
memcpy(canTpPdu.data, diagnosticData, 20);
CanTp_Transmit(&canTpPdu);
```

## Diagnostics over Ethernet

### Ethernet Diagnostics Overview

- **Alive Mechanism:** Maintains active connections with diagnostic tools to ensure continuous communication.

#### DoIP Implementation Example

```c
// Example: Configuring DoIP for diagnostic communication over Ethernet
DoIP_ConfigType doipConfig;
doipConfig.ipAddress = "192.168.0.100";
doipConfig.port = 13400;
doipConfig.protocol = UDS;
DoIP_Init(&doipConfig);

// Sending a diagnostic request
DoIP_PduType doipPdu;
doipPdu.data = diagnosticData;
doipPdu.length = sizeof(diagnosticData);
DoIP_Send(&doipPdu);
```

### Ethernet Communication Stack in AUTOSAR

The Ethernet communication stack within AUTOSAR is structured to provide a hardware-independent interface, ensuring uniformity across different Ethernet controllers and transceivers.

#### Socket Adapter Model

The Socket Adapter model acts as a binding layer between socket connections and Protocol Data Units (PDUs). It interfaces with upper-layer models to send and receive data while interacting with the TCP/IP stack at the lower levels.

**Socket Adapter Responsibilities:**

- **Data Transmission:** Manages sending and receiving of diagnostic data.
- **PDU Binding:** Associates socket connections with specific PDUs for accurate data routing.
- **Interfacing with TCP/IP:** Ensures seamless communication with the underlying TCP/IP models.

**Socket Adapter Implementation Example:**

```c
// Example: Configuring the Socket Adapter for Ethernet diagnostics
SocketAdapter_ConfigType socketConfig;
socketConfig.socketId = 1;
socketConfig.pduId = 100;
SocketAdapter_Init(&socketConfig);

// Sending diagnostic data via Socket Adapter
SocketAdapter_PduType socketPdu;
socketPdu.data = diagnosticData;
socketPdu.length = sizeof(diagnosticData);
SocketAdapter_Send(&socketPdu);
```

#### Ethernet Interface

The Ethernet Interface within the Abstraction Layer provides a standardized, hardware-independent interface to the Ethernet communication system. It abstracts the specifics of Ethernet controllers and transceivers, allowing upper layers to interact uniformly regardless of the underlying hardware.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Uniform Access:** Provides a consistent interface across different Ethernet hardware.
- **Driver Model Integration:** Utilizes Ethernet Driver Models to manage specific hardware features and interfaces.
- **Independence from Hardware:** Ensures that higher layers remain unaffected by changes in Ethernet hardware configurations.

**Ethernet Interface Implementation Example:**

```c
// Example: Initializing the Ethernet Interface
EthIf_ConfigType ethIfConfig;
ethIfConfig.controllerId = 0;
ethIfConfig.speed = ETH_SPEED_100M;
EthIf_Init(&ethIfConfig);

// Receiving data through Ethernet Interface
EthIf_PduType ethIfPdu;
EthIf_Receive(&ethIfPdu);
ProcessReceivedData(ethIfPdu.data, ethIfPdu.length);
```
