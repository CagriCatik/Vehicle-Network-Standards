- **Isolation of Critical Systems:** Ensuring that safety-critical systems (e.g., ADAS) are isolated from non-critical applications to prevent cascading failures.

**Example Code Snippet: Secure Update Rollback Mechanism**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to apply OTA update
apply_update() {
    local update_file=$1
    cp $update_file /vehicle/system/
    reboot_vehicle
}

# Function to rollback update
rollback_update() {
    echo "Rolling back to previous stable version..."
    cp /vehicle/system/backup_v1.2.2.bin /vehicle/system/update.bin
    reboot_vehicle
}

# Verify update integrity and apply
if verify_signature "/vehicle/system/update_v1.2.3.bin" "/vehicle/system/update_v1.2.3.sig" "public_key.pem"; then
    apply_update "/vehicle/system/update_v1.2.3.bin"
