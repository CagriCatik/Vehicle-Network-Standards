            nfcCardId: nfcCardId
        }, {
            headers: {
                'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`
            }
        });
        console.log(`NFC Card ${nfcCardId} mapped to vehicle ${vehicleId}:`, response.data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error mapping NFC Card ${nfcCardId} to vehicle ${vehicleId}:`, error);
    }
}

// Example usage
mapNFCCard('BMW12345', 'NFC9876543210');
```

### Security Enhancements in SDV Level 3

SDV Level 3 introduces advanced security measures to protect the vehicle's extensive software integrations and connectivity features. These enhancements ensure that vehicles remain secure against evolving cyber threats, maintaining user safety and data integrity.

#### Advanced Encryption Techniques

All data transmissions between the vehicle, smartphone, and OEM cloud backend are encrypted using robust algorithms such as AES-256, safeguarding against unauthorized access and data breaches.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

def encrypt_data(data, key):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
    nonce = cipher.nonce
    ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(data.encode('utf-8'))
    return base64.b64encode(nonce + ciphertext).decode('utf-8')

# Example usage
encrypted = encrypt_data("Activate Advanced Navigation", "ThisIsASecretKey")
print(encrypted)
```

#### Identity Management and Access Control

Implementing stringent identity verification and access control mechanisms ensures that only authorized users and systems can interact with critical vehicle functionalities.

```yaml
# YAML configuration for enhanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
roles:
  - name: Admin
    permissions:
      - read
      - write
      - execute
  - name: Technician
    permissions:
      - read
      - write
  - name: User
    permissions:
      - read
      - execute
```

#### Real-Time Monitoring and Intrusion Detection

Continuous monitoring and sophisticated intrusion detection systems protect the vehicle's internal networks from cyber threats, ensuring operational integrity and user safety.

```python
# Python pseudocode for real-time intrusion detection with logging

import time
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, filename='vehicle_security.log', filemode='a',
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def monitor_system():
    while True:
        system_status = check_system_health()
        if system_status['intrusion_detected']:
            alert_security_team(system_status['details'])
            logging.warning(f"Intrusion detected: {system_status['details']}")
        time.sleep(5)  # Monitor every 5 seconds

def check_system_health():
    # Placeholder for actual system health checks
    return {'intrusion_detected': False, 'details': None}

def alert_security_team(details):
    print(f"Alert: Intrusion detected - {details}")
    # Code to notify security team would go here

# Start monitoring
monitor_system()
```

#### Robust Firewall Configurations

Configuring firewalls to permit only trusted connections while blocking all unauthorized traffic enhances the security posture of the vehicleâs internal networks.

```yaml
# YAML configuration for robust firewall rules
firewall:
  rules:
    - name: Allow_Remote_Feature_Updates
      protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      action: allow
    - name: Allow_Voice_Control
      protocol: TCP
      port: 5000
      action: allow
    - name: Block_Untrusted_Services
      protocol: any
      port: any
      action: block
```

#### Rollback Mechanism

Implementing a reliable rollback mechanism ensures that vehicles can revert to previous stable software versions in case an OTA update fails or introduces issues, maintaining vehicle operability and safety.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to apply OTA update
apply_update() {
    local update_file=$1
    cp $update_file /vehicle/system/
    reboot_vehicle
}

# Function to rollback update
rollback_update() {
    echo "Rolling back to previous stable version..."
    cp /vehicle/system/backup_v2.0.0.bin /vehicle/system/update_v3.0.1.bin
    reboot_vehicle
}

# Verify update integrity and apply
if verify_signature "/vehicle/system/update_v3.0.1.bin" "/vehicle/system/update_v3.0.1.sig" "public_key.pem"; then
    apply_update "/vehicle/system/update_v3.0.1.bin"
else
    rollback_update()
fi
```
