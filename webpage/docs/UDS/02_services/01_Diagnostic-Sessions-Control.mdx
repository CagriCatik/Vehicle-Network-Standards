# Diagnostic Session Control - 0x10

The **Diagnostic Session Control (0x10)** service plays a vital role in the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol, managing the access levels to various diagnostic functions in an ECU. It controls the initiation, switching, and termination of diagnostic sessions, thus regulating the type of operations the tester can perform. The UDS protocol is pivotal in vehicle diagnostics, allowing for efficient access to critical vehicle systems, performing in-depth diagnostics, and facilitating ECU reprogramming. This document explains the structure, function, and application of Diagnostic Session Control, providing a deep dive into the different session types, error handling, and real-world use cases.

## Understanding Diagnostic Sessions

### What is a Diagnostic Session?

In UDS, a **diagnostic session** is a specific operational state of an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) that defines what diagnostic services are available to the tester. These sessions control what data can be accessed, what diagnostic tasks can be performed, and how the ECU responds to requests. Each session has varying levels of access:

1. **Basic diagnostic operations**: These are available in the default session and allow the tester to perform simple tasks, such as reading the ECU's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) or general health check.
2. **Advanced diagnostic operations**: Available in specialized sessions such as the extended or safety system sessions, these allow deeper access to the ECU for fault code reading, ECU calibration, and more advanced vehicle diagnostics.
3. **Critical system operations**: Specialized sessions, like the programming session, allow tasks that modify the ECU’s firmware or perform system reprogramming.

### Types of Diagnostic Sessions

Each session type provides different levels of access to the ECU and its systems. The most commonly used diagnostic session types are:

#### 1. **Default Session (0x01)**

- **Purpose**: The Default Session is the basic state of the ECU. It is activated by default when the ECU is powered on or reset. This session is used for basic diagnostic functions, such as reading the VIN or performing general health checks.
- **Usage**: This session is typically used when the technician needs to gather basic vehicle information or perform minimal diagnostics.
- **Example Use Case**: Retrieving the ECU’s VIN or checking if the system is in a safe state for further diagnostics.
- **Request/Response Example**:
  - **Request**: `0x10 0x01` (Initiate Default Session)
  - **Response**: `0x50 0x01` (Positive response confirming Default Session initiation)

#### 2. **Programming Session (0x02)**

- **Purpose**: The Programming Session is used for advanced operations, specifically for reprogramming or updating the ECU’s firmware.
- **Usage**: This session provides access to critical functions like flashing the ECU, which is essential for firmware upgrades, bug fixes, or feature additions.
- **Example Use Case**: Reprogramming the ECU after a software update to fix a known issue or to enhance vehicle functionality.
- **Request/Response Example**:
  - **Request**: `0x10 0x02` (Initiate Programming Session)
  - **Response**: `0x50 0x02` (Positive response confirming Programming Session initiation)

#### 3. **Extended Diagnostic Session (0x03)**

- **Purpose**: This session offers advanced diagnostic capabilities, such as the ability to read and clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), perform ECU calibration, and run in-depth system tests.
- **Usage**: It is used when performing detailed diagnostics on complex systems such as ABS, airbags, or other advanced control units.
- **Example Use Case**: Reading and clearing fault codes from systems like the airbags or performing a system calibration on the anti-lock braking system (ABS).
- **Request/Response Example**:
  - **Request**: `0x10 0x03` (Initiate Extended Diagnostic Session)
  - **Response**: `0x50 0x03` (Positive response confirming Extended Diagnostic Session initiation)

#### 4. **Safety System Diagnostic Session (0x04)**

- **Purpose**: The Safety System Diagnostic Session is dedicated to diagnosing safety-critical systems such as airbags, braking systems, or other safety-related ECUs.
- **Usage**: This session ensures that any faults within critical systems are promptly identified and addressed, ensuring the safety of the vehicle and its occupants.
- **Example Use Case**: Diagnosing faults related to airbag deployment or running diagnostic checks on the vehicle’s brake system.
- **Request/Response Example**:
  - **Request**: `0x10 0x04` (Initiate Safety System Diagnostic Session)
  - **Response**: `0x50 0x04` (Positive response confirming Safety System Diagnostic Session initiation)

## Service Structure for Diagnostic Session Control (0x10)

### Service ID (SID) and Sub-functions

The **Diagnostic Session Control** service is invoked by the Service ID (SID) `0x10`, and it includes different sub-functions to handle the initiation, switching, or termination of diagnostic sessions. These sub-functions allow for precise control over which session type is requested and allow the tester to switch between sessions as necessary.

#### Sub-functions for Diagnostic Session Control

1. **0x01 - Default Session**:
   - **Purpose**: Start the Default Session.
   - **Example Request**: 
     ```hex
     0x10 0x01
     ```
   - **Response**: 
     ```hex
     0x50 0x01
     ```

2. **0x02 - Programming Session**:
   - **Purpose**: Start the Programming Session for critical ECU reprogramming tasks.
   - **Example Request**: 
     ```hex
     0x10 0x02

## How Diagnostic Session Control Works

### Initiating a Session

To initiate a session, the tester sends a request with the desired sub-function. The ECU responds with a positive acknowledgment, confirming the session initiation.

- **Default Session**: When the tester wants to initiate a basic diagnostic check.
- **Programming Session**: Used when flashing or updating the ECU.
- **Extended Diagnostic Session**: Provides access to advanced diagnostic functionalities.

Example:
- **Request**: `0x10 0x01` (Initiate Default Session)
- **Response**: `0x50 0x01` (Confirmation of Default Session)

### Switching Between Sessions

A tester can switch between sessions to gain access to more advanced diagnostics. This typically happens when a technician starts in the Default Session and then switches to a more complex session such as the Extended Diagnostic Session.

Example:
- **Request**: `0x10 0x03` (Switch to Extended Diagnostic Session)
- **Response**: `0x50 0x03` (Confirmation of session switch)

### Terminating a Session

When the diagnostic operations are complete, the tester can terminate the session by requesting a return to the Default Session or a full session termination.

Example:
- **Request**: `0x10 0x01` (Revert to Default Session)
- **Response**: `0x50 0x01` (Confirmation of session termination)

## Real-World Application of Diagnostic Session Control

### Scenario 1: Basic Vehicle Diagnostics

1. **Step 1**: The technician connects the diagnostic tool and initiates a Default Session (`0x10 0x01`) to retrieve basic vehicle information (e.g., VIN, ECU health).
2. **Step 2**: Upon determining that fault codes need to be addressed, the technician switches to an Extended Diagnostic Session (`0x10 0x03`) to read and clear DTCs.
3. **Step 3**: After completing the diagnostic tasks, the technician may return to the Default Session or terminate the session altogether.

### Scenario 2: ECU Reprogramming (Flashing)

1. **Step 1**: The technician initiates the Programming Session (`0x10 0x02`) to begin the process of flashing the ECU with new firmware.
2. **Step 2**: Once the firmware update is completed, the technician returns to the Default Session (`0x10 0x01`).

## Error Handling in Diagnostic Session Control

When the tester attempts to perform an operation in an invalid or unsupported session, the ECU may return a **Negative Response Code (NRC)**. Common error conditions include:

- **0x22 - Conditions Not Correct**: The requested session cannot be initiated due to the current state of the ECU.
- **0x12 - Sub-function Not Supported**: The requested session type is not supported by the ECU.
- **0x13 - Incorrect Message Length**: The message format is incorrect or incomplete.

Example:
- **Request**: `0x10 0x03` (Request for Extended Diagnostic

 Session)
- **Response**: `0x7F 0x10 0x22` (Error: Conditions Not Correct)
