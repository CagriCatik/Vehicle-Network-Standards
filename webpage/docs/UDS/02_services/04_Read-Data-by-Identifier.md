### 2. "Read Data By Identifier" Service (0x22)

The **Read Data By Identifier (0x22)** service is one of the core diagnostic services defined by the UDS protocol. It allows diagnostic tools to request specific pieces of data from the ECU by sending a **Data Identifier**. This identifier indicates the data or parameter to be retrieved.

#### 2.1. Service Flow

1. **Service Request**:
   - A diagnostic tool sends a request to the ECU with the service identifier (`0x22`) and a **Data Identifier**. 
   - The **Data Identifier** specifies the exact data or parameter the tool wants to retrieve.
  
2. **Service Response**:
   - The ECU responds with the requested data or a **Negative Response** if the request cannot be processed.
  
   **Success Response**: The ECU sends the requested data.
   **Negative Response**: If the ECU cannot fulfill the request, an error code is returned, such as when the identifier is unsupported.

#### 2.2. Request Format

The format of the request message is as follows:

| Byte Position | Field             | Description                                              |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1             | Service ID        | Always `0x22` for **Read Data By Identifier**.           |
| 2 and beyond  | Data Identifier   | The identifier for the data to be read from the ECU. This can be one or more bytes. |

Example Request for Software Version (identifier `0x01`):

```
0x22 0x01
```

Where:
- `0x22` is the service ID for **Read Data By Identifier**.
- `0x01` is the identifier for the **Software Version**.

Example Request for Vehicle Speed (identifier `0x02`):

```

##### 2.3.3. Negative Response Example

If the ECU doesn't support the requested identifier (e.g., `0x99`), it may return a **Negative Response** indicating an error.

Request:

```
0x22 0x99
```

Response:

```
0x7F 0x22 0x11
```

Where:
- `0x7F` indicates a **Negative Response**.
- `0x22` is the service ID for **Read Data By Identifier**.
- `0x11` is the error code, which could indicate "Service Not Supported" or "Data Identifier Not Available."

### 3. Data Identifiers

In UDS, each piece of data or parameter within an ECU is identified by a **Data Identifier**. These identifiers are unique for each data point and can be either **standardized** or **manufacturer-specific**.

#### 3.1. Standardized Identifiers

ISO 14229 defines a set of **standardized data identifiers** for commonly accessed parameters. Some examples include:

| Data Identifier | Description                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `0x01`          | ECU Software Version                     |
| `0x02`          | Vehicle Speed                            |
| `0x03`          | Engine RPM                               |
| `0x04`          | Coolant Temperature                      |
| `0x05`          | Fuel Pressure                            |
| `0x06`          | Airbag Status                            |
| `0x07`          | Battery Voltage                          |

These identifiers are consistent across different vehicle makes and models and can be used for general diagnostic purposes.

#### 3.2. Manufacturer-Specific Identifiers

In addition to the standardized identifiers, many manufacturers define their own proprietary data identifiers for specialized parameters. These may relate to calibration data, diagnostic logs, or specific performance metrics for certain ECUs or vehicle models.

For example:
- `0xF1A1` might represent **Vehicle Configuration Data** specific to a manufacturer.
- `0xF1A2` could represent **Proprietary Calibration Data** for an ECU model.

Since these identifiers are not standardized, they typically require specific knowledge of the manufacturer's documentation or the ECU’s Diagnostic Information Database (DID) to decode.
