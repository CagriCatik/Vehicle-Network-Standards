# I/O Control - 0x2F

The **I/O Control (0x2F)** service is an important diagnostic service in the **Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS)** protocol (ISO 14229). It provides a mechanism for controlling and configuring I/O (Input/Output) operations within the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) during diagnostic sessions. This service is versatile and can be used for a wide range of diagnostic tasks, including controlling actuators, reading sensor data, and managing ECU resources.

The **I/O Control** service is particularly useful for testing and calibrating components within the vehicle, such as actuators, sensors, and communication interfaces. It allows the client (e.g., a diagnostic tool) to interact directly with the ECU to perform specific I/O operations.

## **Purpose and Use Cases**

The **I/O Control (0x2F)** service is used in various diagnostic and service scenarios, including but not limited to:

- **Actuator Control**: Activating or controlling specific actuators (e.g., fuel injectors, relays, motors) within the ECU for testing, calibration, or diagnostics.
- **Sensor Data Acquisition**: Requesting real-time sensor data from the ECU, such as temperature, pressure, speed, or other sensor values that the ECU reads.
- **Data Streaming**: Continuous data streaming or reading from sensors or other ECU components for diagnostics or performance monitoring.
- **Test Mode Activation**: Putting specific vehicle components or subsystems into test modes to perform functional testing, diagnostic checks, or system calibrations.
- **Configuring I/O Channels**: Configuring various I/O channels within the ECU, such as enabling/disabling inputs or outputs, adjusting communication parameters, or setting thresholds for triggering actions.

The **I/O Control** service is critical for testing and calibration applications, and it allows the client to directly interact with the ECU to modify or read I/O data, offering fine-grained control over the system's behavior.

## **Overview of the I/O Control (0x2F) Service**

The **I/O Control (0x2F)** service provides a way for the client to request specific actions from the ECU's I/O channels. The service can be used to activate outputs (such as turning on a motor or switching a relay), read inputs (like sensor values), or configure I/O settings (e.g., setting parameters for a communication interface or a test mode). The request frame for the **I/O Control** service includes parameters to specify the type of I/O operation, and the ECU responds with the requested data or an acknowledgment of the action taken.

The service is generally implemented using a flexible, parameterized structure that allows for various diagnostic functions. The operation depends on the requested **IO Control Function**, which could range from reading a specific sensor value to activating a certain vehicle subsystem for testing.

## **Request Frame Format for I/O Control (0x2F)**

The request frame for the **I/O Control (0x2F)** service consists of several parameters that define the operation to be performed and any additional data required by the ECU. Below is the detailed breakdown of the frame format:

| **Byte Number** | **Parameter Name**              | **Description**                                                                                                           |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**           | **SID (Service Identifier)**    | The **Service Identifier** for the **I/O Control** service, which is always **0x2F**.                                      |
| **2**           | **Control Function**            | A 1-byte value specifying the type of I/O operation to perform. This could be activating an output, reading an input, or configuring a setting. |
| **3â€“4**         | **Data Length**                 | A 2-byte field indicating the length of the data or parameters related to the **Control Function** (if applicable).        |
| **5+**          | **Data or Parameters**          | Variable-length data field containing the necessary parameters for the **Control Function**. This could be the specific command or data to interact with the I/O channel. |

### **Control Function Details**

The **Control Function** parameter defines the type of I/O operation to be performed. Some common control functions include:

- **Activate/Deactivate Outputs**: Activating or deactivating specific actuators or relays.
- **Read Sensor Data**: Reading the current value from a sensor.
- **Set Thresholds**: Configuring thresholds for I/O operations (e.g., setting a temperature threshold).
- **Test Mode**: Putting a system or component into a test mode to perform diagnostics.
- **Configure I/O Channel**: Adjusting the configuration of specific I/O channels, such as communication interfaces or sensor input ranges.

Each **Control Function** will have its own specific data format and requirements, depending on the action to be performed.

## **Response Frame Format for I/O Control (0x2F)**

The ECU will respond to the **I/O Control (0x2F)** request with either a **positive** or **negative** response. The response will depend on whether the operation was successfully completed or if any errors were encountered.

### **Positive Response**

If the **I/O Control (0x2F)** request was successfully executed by the ECU, the ECU will send a **positive response** containing the following frame format:

| **Byte Number** | **Parameter Name**             | **Description**                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**           | **PCI Length**                  | Specifies the length of the response frame.                                                                             |
| **2**           | **Response SID**                | The **Service Identifier** for the **I/O Control** response, which is always **0x6F** (0x2F + 0x40).                    |
| **3**           | **Control Function**            | Echoes the **Control Function** from the request frame, indicating the type of I/O operation that was performed.        |
| **4**           | **Response Data**               | Variable-length field containing any data returned by the ECU (e.g., sensor values, confirmation of action taken).     |

The **Response Data** field may contain results such as the read value from a sensor or a confirmation message that the output has been activated successfully.

### **Negative Response**

If the ECU cannot process the **I/O Control (0x2F)** request due to invalid parameters, permissions issues, or other reasons, it will send a **negative response** with the **Negative Response Code (NRC)**. This typically indicates why the I/O operation could not be completed.

| **Byte Number** | **Parameter Name**             | **Description**                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1**           | **PCI Length**                  | Specifies the length of the response frame.                                                                             |
| **2**           | **Request SID**                 | The **Service Identifier** for the **I/O Control** request, which is always **0x2F**.                                    |
| **3**           | **NRC**                         | The **Negative Response Code (NRC)** indicating why the request was rejected.                                          |

### **Supported Negative Response Codes (NRC)**

| **NRC Value** | **Description**                                                    | **Mnemonic**    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **0x13**      | Incorrect message length or invalid format                        | IML             |
| **0x22**      | Conditions not correct (e.g., invalid parameters, I/O channel unavailable) | CNC             |
| **0x31**      | Request out of range (e.g., invalid I/O channel or control function) | ROOR            |
| **0x33**      | Security access denied (e.g., permission issues)                   | SAD             |
| **0x70**      | General programming failure (e.g., failure to execute the requested I/O operation) | GPF             |

## **I/O Control Process**

1. **Initiating the Request**: The client sends a **Request I/O Control (0x2F)** request frame, specifying the desired **Control Function** and any necessary parameters (e.g., I/O channel, sensor type, or threshold values).

2. **Server (ECU) Validation**: Upon receiving the request, the ECU validates the **Control Function** and checks if the requested I/O operation can be executed. If there are any issues (e.g., invalid parameters, insufficient permissions), the ECU sends a **negative response** with an appropriate **NRC**.

3. **I/O Operation Execution**: If the request is valid, the ECU performs the requested I/O operation (e.g., activating an actuator, reading a sensor, or adjusting a configuration). If necessary, the ECU may return data to the client in the **Response Data** field of the response frame.

4. **Completion**: After completing the operation, the ECU sends a **positive response** confirming the action. If the operation was successful, the client can proceed with any further operations or diagnostics. If there was an error, the ECU returns a **negative response** with the **NRC**.
