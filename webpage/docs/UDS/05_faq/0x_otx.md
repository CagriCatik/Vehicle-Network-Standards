# **OTX (Open Test sequence eXchange)**

**Definition**:  
OTX is an international standard (ISO 13209) for describing and exchanging diagnostic test sequences in the automotive domain. It provides a structured and vendor-independent way to define workflows and test sequences, making it a powerful tool for managing diagnostic processes based on **UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services)**.

**Key Features of OTX in UDS Diagnostics**:
1. **Standardized Workflow Description**:
   - OTX provides a formal way to document diagnostic sequences, such as reading diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs), performing ECU resets, or executing end-of-line (EoL) tests.

2. **Interoperability**:
   - By adhering to ISO 13209, OTX ensures compatibility across different diagnostic tools and software platforms, enabling seamless integration in complex diagnostic environments.

3. **Visual Representation**:
   - OTX allows test sequences to be visually represented, making them easier to understand, debug, and communicate.

4. **XML-based Format**:
   - OTX sequences are described in an XML format, which is both machine-readable and human-readable. This ensures the sequences are easy to parse, modify, and share across teams and tools.

5. **Support for UDS Functions**:
   - OTX can encapsulate UDS diagnostic services (e.g., Read Data by Identifier [0x22], Clear Diagnostic Information [0x14]) as part of test workflows.
   - It can sequence multiple UDS services into a coherent test procedure, including conditional logic and error handling.

**Structure of OTX Documents**:
- **Global Definitions**: Shared data and parameters used across multiple sequences.
- **Procedures**: Individual diagnostic workflows or test steps.
- **Variables and Parameters**: Inputs, outputs, and intermediate values used in test sequences.
- **Logic**: Conditional statements, loops, and error-handling routines that control the sequence flow.

**Applications in UDS Diagnostics**:
1. **EoL Testing**:
   - Automating complex sequences for ECU testing during manufacturing.
2. **Diagnostic Routine Execution**:
   - Defining step-by-step procedures for running diagnostic routines like actuator tests or system resets.
3. **Service Validation**:
   - Validating that UDS services respond correctly and meet requirements.
4. **Automated Testing**:
   - Enabling automated regression tests for software updates in ECUs.
5. **Fault Injection Testing**:
   - Testing ECU robustness by simulating specific failure conditions and analyzing responses.

**Advantages**:
- **Consistency**: Ensures all test engineers and systems use a standardized sequence format.
- **Traceability**: Clear documentation of test logic and procedures improves debugging and compliance.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates the reuse and modification of sequences for different ECUs or vehicle platforms.
- **Tool Support**: Widely supported by automotive diagnostic tools such as **Vector vTESTstudio**, **ETAS ODX/OTX Studio**, and others.

**Example Use Case**:
A typical OTX workflow for a UDS diagnostic session might include:
1. Establishing communication with an ECU (e.g., tester presents a diagnostic session request using Service 0x10).
2. Reading specific data (e.g., VIN using Service 0x22).
3. Running a diagnostic routine (e.g., Service 0x31 to control actuators).
4. Logging the responses.
5. Handling errors or retries if the ECU does not respond as expected.
